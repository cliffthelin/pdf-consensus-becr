Everything must test from application code and since its TDD required that means the test has to define what the application method and output will be and test that it runs and results as excpected. ALL tests must be idempotent and output the same as it would be when the user runs the application. Files are defaulted in configuration and before a user interface lets the user select other files it should use targeted active file variables that would be used in final production version. Defaults should never be configured to or designed for the application functions are what should be tested, never tests writing user functions.
