### Validation Steps

1. **Function Catalog Update**

   ```bash
   python functions/rebuild_complete_catalog.py
   python functions/add_field_attributes.py
   python functions/validate_catalog.py
   ```

2. **Default File Integration Validation**

   ```bash
   python validate_function_catalog.py
   ```

3. **Test Coverage Verification**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -v
   python -m pytest tests/adhoc/test_function_catalog_default_file_validation.py -v
   ```

### Task Completion Checklist

- [ ] All new functions documented in function catalog with field attributes

- [ ] All tests pass using real file data (no mocks/stubs)
- [ ] Adhoc validation test updated to cover new functionality
- [ ] `python validate_function_catalog.py` passes completely

### Failure Resolution

If validation fails:

1. Identify missing functions not working with default file
