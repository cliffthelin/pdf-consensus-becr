# Grade 6 Core changes
Standard,Modified/Added/Removed
Throughout,"Examples added or modified to several standards to clarify limits and expectations in Sixth grade. Examples of where this occurs: 6.RP.2, 6.RP.3b, 6.NS.6, 6.EE.2, 6.EE.4,"
6.RP.2 Modified/Footnote moved into standard,"Understand the concept of a unit rate a/b associated with a ratio a:b with b≠0, and use rate language in the context of a ratio relationship. For example, The following are examples of rate language: ""This recipe has a ratio of 3/4 cups of flour to 2 cups of sugar, so there the rate is 3/4 cup 2 cups of flour for each cup of sugar."" ""We paid $75 for 15 hamburgers, which is a rate of $5 per hamburger."" (In sixth grade, unit rates are limited to non-complex fractions.)"
6.RP.3 modified,"Use ratio and rate reasoning to solve real-world (with a context) and mathematical (void of context) problems, e.g., by using strategies such as, reasoning about tables of equivalent ratios, tape diagrams, double number line diagrams, or equations involving unit rate problems."
Standard,Modified/Added/Removed
6.NS.1 modified,"Interpret and compute quotients of fractions. and solve word problems involving division of fractions by fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. For example, create a story context for (2/3) ÷ (3/4) and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient; use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that (2/3) ÷ (3/4) = 8/9 because 3/4 of 8/9 is 2/3. (In general, (a/b) ÷ (c/d) = ad/bc.) How much chocolate will each person get if 3 people share ½ lb of chocolate equally? How many 3/4 cup servings are in 2/3 of a cup of yogurt? How wide is a rectangular strip of land with length 3/4 mile and area 1/2 square mile?
a. Compute quotients of fractions by fractions, for example, by applying strategies such as visual fraction models, equations, and the relationship between multiplication and division, to represent problems.
b. Solve real-world problems involving division of fractions by fractions. For example, how much chocolate will each person get if three people share 1/2 pound of chocolate equally? How many 3/4-cup servings are in 2/3 of a cup of yogurt? How wide is a rectangular strip of land with length 3/4 mile and area 1/2 square mile?
c. Explain the meaning of quotients in fraction division problems. For example, create a story context for (2/3) ÷ (3/4) and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that (2/3) ÷ (3/4) = 8/9 because 3/4 of 8/9 is 2/3. (In general, (a/b) ÷ (c/d) = ad/bc.)"
6.NS.3 added,"Fluently add, subtract, multiply, and divide multi-digit decimals using the standard algorithm for each operation.
a. Fluently divide multi-digit decimals using the standard algorithm, limited to a whole number dividend with a decimal divisor or a decimal dividend with a whole number divisor.
b. Solve division problems in which both the dividend and the divisor are multi-digit decimals; develop the standard algorithm by using models, the meaning of division, and place value understanding."
6.EE.2 modified,"Write, read, and evaluate expressions in which letters represent numbers.
a. Write expressions that record operations with numbers and with letters representing numbers. For example: Express the calculation ""Subtract y from 5"" as 5 - y. ""Jane had $105.00 in her bank account. One year later she had x dollars more. Write an expression that shows her new balance"" as $105.00 + x.
b. Identify parts of an expression using mathematical terms (sum, term, product, factor, quotient, coefficient); view one or more parts of an expression as a single entity and a sum of two terms. For example, describe the expression 2 {8 + 7} as a product of two factors; view {8 + 7} as both a single entity and a sum of two terms.
c. Evaluate expressions at specific values of their variables. Include expressions that arise from formulas used in real-world problems. Perform arithmetic operations, including those involving whole-number exponents, in the conventional order applying the Order of Operations when there are no parentheses to specify a particular order (Order of Operations). For example, use the formulas V = s³ and A = 6 s² to find the volume and surface area of a cube with sides of length s = 1/2."

Standard,Modified/Added/Deleted
7.SP.1 modified,"Understand that statistics can be used to gain information about a population by examining a sample of the population, and that generalizations about a population from a sample are valid only if the sample is representative of that population. Understand that random sampling tends is more likely to produce representative samples and support valid inferences."
7.SP.3 modified,"Informally assess the degree of visual overlap of two numerical data distributions with similar variabilities, estimating the difference between the centers by expressing it as a multiple of a measure of variability. For example, the mean height of players on the basketball team is 10 cm greater than the mean height of players on the soccer team, about approximately twice the variability (mean absolute deviation) on either team; on a dot plot, the separation between the two distributions of heights is noticeable."

8.EE.8b modified,"Solve systems of two linear equations in two variables algebraically, and estimate solutions by graphing the equations graphically, approximating when solutions are not integers. Solve simple cases by inspection. For example, 3x + 2y = 5 and 3x + 2y = 6 have no solution because 3x + 2y cannot simultaneously be 5 and 6."

8.G.3 modified,"Observe that orientation of the plane is preserved in rotations and translations, but not with reflections. Describe the effect of dilations, translations, rotations, and reflections on two-dimensional figures using coordinates."
8.G.6 modified,Explore and explain proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse.
8.SP.3 Footnote moved into standard,"Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems in the context of bivariate measurement data, interpreting the slope and intercept. For example, in a linear model for a biology experiment, interpret a slope of 1.5 cm/hr as meaning that an additional hour of sunlight each day is associated with an additional 1.5 cm in mature plant height. (Calculating equations for a linear model is not expected in grade 8.)"
