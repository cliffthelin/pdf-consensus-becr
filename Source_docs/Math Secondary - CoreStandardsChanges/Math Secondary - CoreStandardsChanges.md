# Secondary Mathematics Utah Core Changes

How to read the grade level standards

**Standards** define what students should understand and be able to do.

**Strands** (formerly known as Domains) are groups of related standards. The paragraph beneath each strand is a description of the standards (often references are made to specific standards within this paragraph).

**Format Changes:** Cluster Titles have been removed to be consistent with other subject area cores. They have been combined and are a **Description** of the Strand.
In high school, the instructional notes located within the cluster have been embedded into the standards to provide clarity and specify depth of a given standard.

Core changes: Key

Bold: Addition to standards not previously in the core are **bold**.
Underline: Relocation of standards information from footnotes (middle school) or instructional notes (high school) are **underlined**.
Strikethrough: Removals use **strikethrough**.
