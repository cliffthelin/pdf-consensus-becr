UTAH WORLD LANGUAGES CORE STANDARDS FOR PROFICIENCY
,,,,
"For teachers, the purpose is to:",
"1. guide facilitation of language learning toward more functional, communicative and intercultural
goals, rather than those of language structure and cultural fact.",,,
"2. provide examples of leaming targets that can be used across ages, class levels, or content studied.",,,
"3. suggest leaming experiences, scenarios, and integrated performance assessment tasks.",,,
"4. provide a cross-check for ensuring that each mode of communication and skill is addressed at each
level.",,,
5. clarify what leamers need to be able to do in order to move from one level to the next.,,,
,,,,
"For parents, administrators, and other stakeholders, the purpose is to:",
"1. demonstrate how world language leaming has moved from a focus on grammar and translation
toward effective communication, literacy, and cultural interaction.",,,
"2. demonstrate how the shift has occurred in classical languages from decoding and translation to
interpretive reading proficiency.",,,
3. define exactly what is expected of leamers at different levels of proficiency.,,,
4. emphasize real-world application for language use.,,,
,,,,
"Why does the Utah World Languages Core Standards for Proficiency apply to all learners regardless of
grade level?"
,,,,
"Leamers begin new language experiences at different ages and progress toward proficiency at different rates.
The amount of quality time spent in the target language (i.e., dual language immersion vs. high school level I) is
a determining factor in the proficiency level that learners will reach. Learners at similar ages frequently
demonstrate varying proficiency levels in all three modes of communication when assessed. The Utah World
Languages Core Standard for Proficiency outlines the progression of leamer skills, making it easier for teachers
to identify a leamer's skill level and to differentiate leaming for all leamers."
,,,,
How does the Utah World Languages Core Standards for Proficiency apply to heritage speakers?
,,,,
"Leamers bring a variety of languages and cultures to Utah. They may have leamed a language at home, in
another country, or through local communities. Some may decide to pursue the study of their native language,
while others may decide to study a different language. When heritage speakers choose to continue their native
language, differentiated leaming must take place to meet their needs."
,,,,
"When determining the placement of heritage speakers in language courses, consideration should be given to
proficiency levels rather than seat time. Within language courses, the performance indicators allow teachers to
set class goals while allowing leamers to modify them to meet their own personal learning goals. Heritage
speakers may demonstrate varying levels of proficiency across the three modes of communication:
interpersonal, interpretive and presentational. For example, they may perform at a higher level of proficiency in
the interpersonal mode than in the presentational mode. The benchmarks and indicators identify the leamer's
skill and modify the learning experience to meet the leamer's needs. When possible, specially designed
language courses for heritage speakers are optimal."
,,,,
"How does the Utah World Languages Core Standards for Proficiency align with the new Utah Core
Standards?"

UTAH WORLD LANGUAGES CORE STANDARDS FOR PROFICIENCY,
"As indicated in the Oral Proficiency Levels in the Work World chart above, language preparation for career",
readiness necessitates higher levels of proficiency than established by current language requirements for high,
school graduation and college entrance.,
•,Are there multiple articulated language pathways?
THREE ARTICULATION PATHWAYS,
Three articulation pathway models have been developed for implementation throughout the State of,
"Utah and allow for entry at various points in the K-12 system: in elementary Dual Language Immersion, early",
Secondary and late Secondary language programs.,
Elementary Dual Language Immersion Pathway,
Students in the elementary immersion pathway enter in kindergarten or first grade and exit at sixth grade,
(in some instances fifth grade). A minimum of 50% of content curriculum is conducted in the target language,
daily. The elementary Dual Language Immersion pathway continues in early Secondary with three years of,
"specialized content study where students are offered two courses per year, one in a content area and a second",
honors-level target language course. Students in ninth grade take the target language AP course and,
examination on exit. Dual Language Immersion pathway students entering high school are offered advanced-,
level target language courses equivalent to 3000 (300) level university courses. These courses will allow high,
school students to earn college credit towards a target language minor through articulation agreements with,
"Utah university institutions. In addition, Dual Language Immersion students are encouraged to start the study of",
a third language in tenth grade.,
Early Secondary Pathway,
Students enter the early Secondary pathway in seventh grade (in some cases sixth grade) and are given,
one target language course per year for six years. Students take the target language AP course and examination,
in the eleventh or twelfth grade.,
Late Secondary Pathway,
Students enter the late secondary pathway in the ninth or tenth grade with one target language course per,
year for three to four years. Some accelerated students take the target language AP course and examination in,
twelfth grade.,
