## Scope and Sequence

Reading engagement is a foundational skill for learning, personal growth, and enjoyment. The degree to which students can read and understand text in all formats and all contexts is a key indicator of success in school and in life. The goal is to actively promote reading and provide equitable access to literary and informational texts in a variety of subjects, genres, and formats. The standards facilitate the acquisition of tools, knowledge and skills to allow every student to read for interpretation and the development of new understandings.

### Strand 1: Reading for intellectual, personal, and emotional growth

Standard 1: Establish reading behaviors for lifelong learning and growth.

**Information and Research:** Through engagement in the research process, students will apply critical thinking skills (e.g., analysis, evaluation, organization, synthesis) to draw conclusions and construct new understandings. Additionally, students will engage in research processes (e.g., inquiry-based, information problem solving). Such experiences will develop student self-confidence in solving problems in an environment where information resources and technologies are increasingly complex.

**Media Literacy** is the competent application of literacy skills to media and technology messages. Its goal is to help students develop the habits of inquiry and skills of expression that they need to be critical thinkers, effective communicators, and active, digital citizens in today’s world. By learning the standards and objectives, students will acquire an understanding of the elements, construction, and potential impact of media messages while learning to make informed choices in the use of media. Through collaboration with classroom teachers, these standards can be integrated into curricular units throughout a wide range of subjects to ensure students are equipped with these essential 21st century skills.
