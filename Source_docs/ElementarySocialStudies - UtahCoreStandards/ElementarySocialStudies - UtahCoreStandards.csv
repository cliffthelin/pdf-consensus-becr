Utah Elementary
Social Studies Standards
Elementary students are deeply curious and full of questions. They may ask,
How did people build those things?” or “Why can't countries seem to get along? or
"even “How can I make a difference in the world?"" One place they can find answers"
is in social studies. Social Studies is the study of the physical world and our place in
it, which involves oral traditions, biographies, dances, artifacts, writings and original
documents, and other aspects of culture that comprise the record of human life.
Effective social studies instruction in the elementary classroom encourages
this inherent curiosity of young people. A firm grounding in rich and engaging con-
tent knowledge about history, geography, civics, and economics lifts learning for all
students. This rich content knowledge — coupled with essential skills development
helps students deepen their understanding of the world around them. This deep-
er understanding will also help reach a central overarching goal of effective social
studies instruction: to help young people develop civic competence including the
ability to make informed decisions for the public good.
Developing civic competence is one of the fundamental purposes of public
schools. The Utah State Board of Education's vision statement strives for the civic en-
gagement of students, as well as civic education. Utah statute defines civic education
as “the cultivation of informed, responsible participation in political life by competent
citizens committed to the fundamental values and principles of representative de-
mocracy in Utah and the United States.” A thorough study of American history and
government is an essential component of responsible citizenship.
The future progress of our communities, state, nation, and world rests upon
the preparation of young people to collaboratively and deliberately address prob-
lems, defend their own rights and liberties as well as the rights and liberties of oth-
ers - and to balance personal preferences with the common good. E pluribus unum,
"or ""out of many one",” emphasizes the idea that a varied and diverse people contrib-
ute to a unifying national identity. This rich phrase adds depth and understanding to
our complex national history. Students are led to enquire about the character and
talents of all Americans, which in turn promotes a greater understanding about their
own individual contributions and the value they add to this nation.
Social studies offers the ideal venue to nurture civic virtue, consider current
issues, practice acting civilly toward others, build a civic identity, bolster historical
awareness of governmental structures, and cultivate global awareness. These skills,
habits, and qualities of character will better prepare students to recognize and accept
responsibility for preserving and defending the liberties secured by the Constitution.

UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for SOCIAL STUDIES
"To reach these ends, students should have ample opportunities to:"
"■ Engage in deliberative, collaborative, and civil dialogue regarding historical and current issues."
"■ Apply knowledge of governmental structure, historic concepts, geographic interrelationships, and economic principles to analyze and explain current events."
"■ Identify local, state, national, or international issues; consider solutions and understand who best can address the needs; and share their ideas with appropriate public and/or private stakeholders."
"■ Develop and demonstrate the values that sustain America's constitution-al democratic republic, such as open-mindedness, engagement, honesty, problem-solving, responsibility, diligence, resilience, empathy, self-control, respect for the beliefs of others, and cooperation, as well as its foundation-al principles, such as limited government, separation of state and federal governance, and free-market economy."
■ Engage in dialogue regarding American exceptionalism in the sense of the special character of the United States as a free nation based on democratic ideals and personal liberty.
"Civic competence requires an awareness of self and others. Social studies provides the underpinnings for civic awareness and action and exposes the histo-ry and wonders of cultures. Disciplines as varied as history, geography, economics, and civics provide clearer vision as students interpret, analyze, and make sense of the world. Access to and use of primary and secondary sources are foundational to understanding historical events. Ideas and concepts central to the purpose of public education are also central to social studies, among them the notion of the common good, the value of self-rule and self determination, the dignity and necessity of hon-est labor, respect for parents, home, and family, the rights and responsibilities we humans share, and the interconnectedness of human endeavor. With their applica-tion of democratic processes, personal responsibility, and life skills, students will be prepared to protect the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution, improving their lives and the lives of all members of society."
The Organization of the Elementary Social Studies Standards
"Utah standards are organized into strands, which represent significant areas of learning within content areas. Depending on the core area or grade level, these strands may be designated by time periods, thematic principles, modes of practice, or other organizing principles."
"Within each strand are standards. A standard is an articulation of the demon-strated proficiency to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery."
Compelling questions have been included for possible use by teachers to support and reinforce the essential role of inquiry in social studies.
