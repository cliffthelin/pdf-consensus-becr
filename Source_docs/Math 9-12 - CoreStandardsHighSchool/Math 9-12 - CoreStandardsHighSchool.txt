The Utah Core Standards are aligned to scientifically based content standards. They drive high quality instruction through statewide comprehensive expectations for all students. The standards outline essential knowledge, concepts, and skills to be mastered at each grade level or within a critical content area.

A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficiency to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.",

            "level": 2,
            "content": "These standards define what students should understand and be able to do in their study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student's mathematical maturity, why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from. Mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness.\n\nThe standards set grade-specific standards but do not dictate curriculum or teaching methods, nor do they define the intervention methods or materials necessary to support students who are well below or well above grade-level expectations. It is also beyond the scope of the Standards to define the full range of supports appropriate for English language learners and for students with special needs. At the same time, all students must have the opportunity to learn and meet the same high standards if they are to access the knowledge and skills necessary in their post-school lives. The standards should be read as allowing for the widest possible range of students to participate fully from the outset, along with appropriate accommodations to ensure maximum participation of students with special education needs. No set of grade-specific standards can fully reflect the great variety in abilities, needs, learning rates, and achievement levels of students in any given classroom. However, the standards do provide clear signposts along the way to the goal of college and career readiness for all students.\n\nWhat students can learn at any particular grade level depends upon what they have learned before. Ideally then, each standard in this document might have been phrased in the form, \"Students who already know... should next come to learn...\" Grade placements for specific topics have been made on the basis of state and international comparisons and the collective experience and collective professional judgment of educators, researchers and mathematicians. Learning opportunities will continue to vary across schools and school systems, and educators should make every effort to meet the needs of individual students based on their current understanding.",

Students will learn function notation and develop the concepts of domain and range. They move beyond viewing functions as processes that take inputs and yield outputs, and start viewing functions as objects in their own right. They explore many examples of functions, including sequences; they interpret functions given graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally, translate between representations, and understand the limitations of various representations. They work with functions given by graphs and tables, keeping in mind that, depending upon the context, these representations are likely to be approximate and incomplete. Their work includes functions that can be described or approximated by formulas, as well as those that cannot. When functions describe relationships between quantities arising from a context, students reason with the units in which those quantities are measured. Students build on and informally extend their understanding of integer exponents to consider exponential functions. They compare and contrast linear and exponential functions, distinguishing between additive and multiplicative change. They interpret arithmetic sequences as linear functions and geometric sequences as exponential functions.",

Notice if reasoning is repeated, and look for both generalizations and shortcuts. Evaluate the reasonableness of intermediate results by maintaining oversight of the process while attending to the details.\n\n## Strand: NUMBER AND QUANTITY—The Real Number System (N.RN)\n\nExtend the properties of exponents to rational exponents (Standards N.RN.1–2). Use properties of rational and irrational numbers (Standard N.RN. 3).\n\n*   **Standard N.RN.1** Explain how the definition of the meaning of rational exponents follows from extending the properties of integer exponents to those values, allowing for a notation for radicals in terms of rational exponents. *For example, we define 5¹/³ to be the cube root of 5 because we want (5¹/³)³ = 5(¹/³)³ to hold, so (5¹/³)³ must equal 5.*\n\n*   **Standard N.RN.2** Rewrite expressions involving radicals and rational exponents using the properties of exponents.\n\n*   **Standard N.RN.3** Explain why sums and products of rational numbers are rational, that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational, and that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational. Connect to physical situations (e.g., finding the perimeter of a square of area 2).\n\n## Strand: NUMBER AND QUANTITY—The Complex Number System (N.CN)\n\nPerform arithmetic operations with complex numbers (Standards N.CN.1–2). Use complex numbers in polynomial identities and equations (Standards N.CN.7–9).\n\n*   **Standard N.CN.1** Know there is a complex number $i$ such that $i^2 = -1$, and every complex number has the form $a + bi$ with $a$ and $b$ real.\n\n*   **Standard N.CN.2** Use the relation $i^2 = -1$ and the commutative, associative, and distributive properties to add, subtract, and multiply complex numbers. Limit to multiplications that involve $i^2$ as the highest power of $i$.\n\n*   **Standard N.CN.7** Solve quadratic equations with real coefficients that have complex solutions.\n\n*   **Standard N.CN.8** Extend polynomial identities to the complex numbers. Limit to quadratics with real coefficients. *For example, rewrite $x^2 + 4$ as $(x + 2i)(x - 2i)$.*\n\n&lt;page_number&gt;SECONDARY MATHEMATICS III | 18&lt;/page_number&gt;\n<footer>ADA Compliant May 2021</footer>",

Students identify zeros of polynomials and make connections between zeros of polynomials and solutions of polynomial equations. The unit culminates with the fundamental theorem of algebra. Rational numbers extend the arithmetic of integers by allowing division by all numbers except 0.

The course extends students’ understanding of the mathematics developed in Algebra 1 and Geometry. The course is intended to help students develop an understanding of how mathematics describes and explains the world in which they live. Students will extend their mathematical literacy, problem-solving skills, and enthusiasm for the power and beauty of mathematics as a tool for quantifying their world.\n\nTeachers will select a minimum of five objectives per semester to explore, and may modify indicators to meet those objectives. Teachers are encouraged to select topics which are of particular interest to their students. Because the topics within the course are not intended to build on one another, students may enter or exit the class throughout the academic year.",
