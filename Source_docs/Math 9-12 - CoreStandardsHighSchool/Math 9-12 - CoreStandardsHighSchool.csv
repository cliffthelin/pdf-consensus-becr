UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for MATHEMATICS
SECONDARY MATHEMATICS I
"THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF SECONDARY MATHEMATICS I is to formalize and
extend the mathematics that students learned in the middle grades. The critical areas, or-
ganized into units, deepen and extend understanding of linear relationships, in part by con-
trasting them with exponential phenomena, and in part by applying linear models to data
that exhibit a linear trend. Secondary Mathematics I uses properties and theorems involving
congruent figures to deepen and extend understanding of geometric knowledge from prior
grades. The final unit in the course ties together the algebraic and geometric ideas studied.
The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the
content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and
logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations."
"CRITICAL AREA 1: By the end of eighth grade, students have had a variety of experi-
ences working with expressions and creating equations. Students continue this work
by using quantities to model and analyze situations, to interpret expressions, and by
creating equations to describe situations."
"CRITICAL AREA 2: In earlier grades, students define, evaluate, and compare functions,
and use them to model relationships between quantities. Students will learn function
notation and develop the concepts of domain and range. They move beyond view-
ing functions as processes that take inputs and yield outputs, and start viewing func-
tions as objects in their own right. They explore many examples of functions, including
sequences; they interpret functions given graphically, numerically, symbolically, and
verbally, translate between representations, and understand the limitations of various
representations. They work with functions given by graphs and tables, keeping in mind
that, depending upon the context, these representations are likely to be approximate
and incomplete. Their work includes functions that can be described or approximated
by formulas, as well as those that cannot. When functions describe relationships be-
tween quantities arising from a context, students reason with the units in which those
quantities are measured. Students build on and informally extend their understanding
of integer exponents to consider exponential functions. They compare and contrast
linear and exponential functions, distinguishing between additive and multiplicative
change. They interpret arithmetic sequences as linear functions and geometric se-
quences as exponential functions."
"CRITICAL AREA 3: By the end of eighth grade, students have learned to solve linear
equations in one variable and have applied graphical and algebraic methods to ana-
lyze and solve systems of linear equations in two variables. This area builds on these
earlier experiences by asking students to analyze and explain the process of solving
an equation and to justify the process used in solving a system of equations. Students
develop fluency writing, interpreting, and translating between various forms of linear
equations and inequalities, and using them to solve problems. They master the solu-
tion of linear equations and apply related solution techniques and the laws of expo-
nents to the creation and solution of simple exponential equations. Students explore"

"systems of equations and inequalities, and they find and interpret their solutions. All
of this work is grounded on understanding quantities and on relationships between
them."
"CRITICAL AREA 4: This area builds upon students' prior experiences with data, provid-
ing students with more formal means of assessing how a model fits data. Students use
regression techniques to describe approximately linear relationships between quanti-
ties. They use graphical representations and knowledge of the context to make judg-
ments about the appropriateness of linear models. With linear models, they look at
residuals to analyze the goodness of fit."
"CRITICAL AREA 5: In previous grades, students were asked to draw triangles based
on given measurements. They also have prior experience with rigid motions (transla-
tions, reflections, and rotations) and have used these to develop notions about what it
means for two objects to be congruent. In this unit, students establish triangle congru-
ence criteria, based on analyses of rigid motions and formal constructions. They solve
problems about triangles, quadrilaterals, and other polygons. They apply reasoning to
complete geometric constructions and explain why they work."
"CRITICAL AREA 6: Building on their work with the Pythagorean Theorem in eighth
grade to find distances, students use a rectangular coordinate system to verify geo-
metric relationships, including properties of special triangles and quadrilaterals and
slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines."

COLLEGE PREP MATHEMATICS
Prerequisite: Secondary III
College Prep Math formalizes and reinforces concepts from the Secondary Mathematics series
to provide students with the foundational skills and understanding prerequisite to College
Algebra (1050). Students will reason abstractly and quantitatively while solving linear and
quadratic equations and linear inequalities. They will efficiently use polynomial and rational
expressions and functions, radicals and complex numbers, and exponential and logarithmic
expressions and functions to model and solve mathematical problems. They will explore conic
sections and represent parabolic data. Throughout this course, students will make sense of
problems and persevere in solving them, use tools strategically, and attend to precision.
Standard I: Students will develop fluency with the language and operations of alge-
bra to evaluate, analyze, and solve problems.
Objective 1: Perform operations and simplify expressions with rational,
irrational, and complex numbers.
a. Rewrite expressions involving radicals and rational exponents using
the properties of exponents.
b. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide radical expressions.
c. Simplify expressions involving complex numbers and express them
in standard form, a + bi.
Objective 2: Solve systems of equations and inequalities.
a. Solve systems of linear equations in two variables algebraically and
graphically.
b. Solve a simple system consisting of a linear equation and a quadratic
equation in two variables algebraically and graphically.
c. Use matrices to solve systems of linear equations.*
d. Model and solve problems arising from authentic situations using
systems of equations and inequalities.
Objective 3: Solve and graph quadratic equations.
a. Use the method of completing the square to transform any quadrat-
ic equation into an equation of the form (x – p)² = q, and use this to
derive the quadratic formula.
b. Solve quadratic equations by inspection, taking square roots, factor-
ing, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula.
c. Model and solve real-world situations using quadratic relationships
in two variables.
