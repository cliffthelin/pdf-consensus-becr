The Utah State Board of Education, in January of 1984, established policy requiring the identification of specific core standards to be met by all K-12 students in order to graduate from Utah's secondary schools. The Utah State Board of Education regularly updates the Utah Core Standards, while parents, teachers, and local school boards continue to control the curriculum choices that reflect local values.

The Utah Core Standards are aligned to scientifically based content standards. They drive high quality instruction through statewide comprehensive expectations for all students. The standards outline essential knowledge, concepts, and skills to be mastered at each grade level or within a critical content area. The standards provide a foundation for ensuring learning within the classroom.

# INTRODUCTION

## Organization of the Standards
The Utah Core Standards are organized into **strands**, which represent significant areas of learning within content areas. Depending on the core area, these strands may be designated by time periods, thematic principles, modes of practice, or other organizing principles.

Within each strand are **standards**. A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficiency to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.

## Understanding Mathematics
These standards define what students should understand and be able to do in their study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student's mathematical maturity, why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from. Mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness.

The standards set grade-specific standards but do not dictate curriculum or teaching methods, nor do they define the intervention methods or materials necessary to support students who are well below or well above grade-level expectations. It is also beyond the scope of the Standards to define the full range of supports appropriate for English language learners and for students with special needs. At the same time, all students must have the opportunity to learn and meet the same high standards if they are to access the knowledge and skills necessary in their post-school lives. The standards should be read as allowing for the widest possible range of students to participate fully from the outset, along with appropriate accommodations to ensure maximum participation of students with special education needs. No set of grade-specific standards can fully reflect the great variety in abilities, needs, learning rates, and achievement levels of students in any given classroom. However, the standards do provide clear signposts along the way to the goal of college and career readiness for all students.

What students can learn at any particular grade level depends upon what they have learned before. Ideally then, each standard in this document might have been phrased in the form, "Students who already know... should next come to learn..." Grade placements for specific topics have been made on the basis of state and international comparisons and the collective experience and collective professional judgment of educators, researchers and mathematicians. Learning opportunities will continue to vary across schools and school systems, and educators should make every effort to meet the needs of individual students based on their current understanding.

# SECONDARY MATHEMATICS I

**THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF SECONDARY MATHEMATICS I** is to formalize and extend the mathematics that students learned in the middle grades. The critical areas, organized into units, deepen and extend understanding of linear relationships, in part by contrasting them with exponential phenomena, and in part by applying linear models to data that exhibit a linear trend. Secondary Mathematics I uses properties and theorems involving congruent figures to deepen and extend understanding of geometric knowledge from prior grades. The final unit in the course ties together the algebraic and geometric ideas studied. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations.

**CRITICAL AREA 1:** By the end of eighth grade, students have had a variety of experiences working with expressions and creating equations. Students continue this work by using quantities to model and analyze situations, to interpret expressions, and by creating equations to describe situations.

**CRITICAL AREA 2:** In earlier grades, students define, evaluate, and compare functions, and use them to model relationships between quantities. Students will learn function notation and develop the concepts of domain and range. They move beyond viewing functions as processes that take inputs and yield outputs, and start viewing functions as objects in their own right. They explore many examples of functions, including sequences; they interpret functions given graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally, translate between representations, and understand the limitations of various representations. They work with functions given by graphs and tables, keeping in mind that, depending upon the context, these representations are likely to be approximate and incomplete. Their work includes functions that can be described or approximated by formulas, as well as those that cannot. When functions describe relationships between quantities arising from a context, students reason with the units in which those quantities are measured. Students build on and informally extend their understanding of integer exponents to consider exponential functions. They compare and contrast linear and exponential functions, distinguishing between additive and multiplicative change. They interpret arithmetic sequences as linear functions and geometric sequences as exponential functions.

**CRITICAL AREA 3:** By the end of eighth grade, students have learned to solve linear equations in one variable and have applied graphical and algebraic methods to analyze and solve systems of linear equations in two variables. This area builds on these earlier experiences by asking students to analyze and explain the process of solving an equation and to justify the process used in solving a system of equations. Students develop fluency writing, interpreting, and translating between various forms of linear equations and inequalities, and using them to solve problems. They master the solution of linear equations and apply related solution techniques and the laws of exponents to the creation and solution of simple exponential equations. Students explore

systems of equations and inequalities, and they find and interpret their solutions. All of this work is grounded on understanding quantities and on relationships between them.

**CRITICAL AREA 4:** This area builds upon students’ prior experiences with data, providing students with more formal means of assessing how a model fits data. Students use regression techniques to describe approximately linear relationships between quantities. They use graphical representations and knowledge of the context to make judgments about the appropriateness of linear models. With linear models, they look at residuals to analyze the goodness of fit.

**CRITICAL AREA 5:** In previous grades, students were asked to draw triangles based on given measurements. They also have prior experience with rigid motions (translations, reflections, and rotations) and have used these to develop notions about what it means for two objects to be congruent. In this unit, students establish triangle congruence criteria, based on analyses of rigid motions and formal constructions. They solve problems about triangles, quadrilaterals, and other polygons. They apply reasoning to complete geometric constructions and explain why they work.

**CRITICAL AREA 6:** Building on their work with the Pythagorean Theorem in eighth grade to find distances, students use a rectangular coordinate system to verify geometric relationships, including properties of special triangles and quadrilaterals and slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines.

## Strand: MATHEMATICAL PRACTICES (MP)

The Standards for Mathematical Practice in Secondary Mathematics I describe mathematical habits of mind that teachers should seek to develop in their students. Students become mathematically proficient in engaging with mathematical content and concepts as they learn, experience, and apply these skills and attitudes (Standards MP.1–8).

*   **Standard SI.MP.1** Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. Explain the meaning of a problem and look for entry points to its solution. Analyze givens, constraints, relationships, and goals. Make conjectures about the form and meaning of the solution, plan a solution pathway, and continually monitor progress asking, “Does this make sense?” Consider analogous problems, make connections between multiple representations, identify the correspondence between different approaches, look for trends, and transform algebraic expressions to highlight meaningful mathematics. Check answers to problems using a different method.

*   **Standard SI.MP.2** Reason abstractly and quantitatively. Make sense of the quantities and their relationships in problem situations. Translate between context and algebraic representations by contextualizing and decontextualizing quantitative relationships. This includes the ability to decontextualize a given situation, representing it algebraically and manipulating symbols fluently as well as the ability to contextualize algebraic representations to make sense of the problem.

*   **Standard SI.MP.3** Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. Understand and use stated assumptions, definitions, and previously established results in constructing arguments. Make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the truth of their conjectures. Justify conclusions and communicate them to others. Respond to the arguments of others by listening, asking clarifying questions, and critiquing the reasoning of others.

*   **Standard SI.MP.4** Model with mathematics. Apply mathematics to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. Make assumptions and approximations, identifying important quantities to construct a mathematical model. Routinely interpret mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on whether the results make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not served its purpose.

*   **Standard SI.MP.5** Use appropriate tools strategically. Consider the available tools and be sufficiently familiar with them to make sound decisions about when each tool might be helpful, recognizing both the insight to be gained as well as the limitations. Identify relevant external mathematical resources and use them to pose or solve problems. Use tools to explore and deepen their understanding of concepts.

*   **Standard SI.MP.6** Attend to precision. Communicate precisely to others. Use explicit definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning. They state the meaning of the symbols they choose. Specify units of measure and label axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. Calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of precision appropriate for the problem context.

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for MATHEMATICS

*   **Standard SI.MP.7** Look for and make use of structure. Look closely at mathematical relationships to identify the underlying structure by recognizing a simple structure within a more complicated structure. See complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as being composed of several objects. *For example, see 5 – 3(x – y)² as 5 minus a positive number times a square and use that to realize that its value cannot be more than 5 for any real numbers x and y.*

*   **Standard SI.MP.8** Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning. Notice if reasoning is repeated, and look for both generalizations and shortcuts. Evaluate the reasonableness of intermediate results by maintaining oversight of the process while attending to the details.

## Strand: NUMBER AND QUANTITY—Quantities (N.Q)

Reason quantitatively and use units to solve problems. Working with quantities and the relationships between them provides grounding for work with expressions, equations, and functions (Standards N.Q.1–3).

*   **Standard N.Q.1** Use units as a way to understand problems and to guide the solution of multi-step problems; choose and interpret units consistently in formulas; choose and interpret the scale and the origin in graphs and data displays.

*   **Standard N.Q.2** Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling.

*   **Standard N.Q.3** Choose a level of accuracy appropriate to limitations on measurement when reporting quantities.

## Strand: ALGEBRA—Seeing Structure in Expressions (A.SSE)

Interpret the structure of expressions (Standard A.SSE.1).

*   **Standard A.SSE.1** Interpret linear expressions and exponential expressions with integer exponents that represent a quantity in terms of its context.★
    *   a. Interpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coefficients.
    *   b. Interpret complicated expressions by viewing one or more of their parts as a single entity. *For example, interpret P(1+r)ⁿ as the product of P and a factor not depending on P.*

## Strand: ALGEBRA—Creating Equations (A.CED)

Create equations that describe numbers or relationships. Limit these to linear equations and inequalities, and exponential equations. In the case of exponential equations, limit to situations requiring evaluation of exponential functions at integer inputs (Standards A.CED.1–4).

*   **Standard A.CED.1** Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them to solve problems. Include equations arising from linear and simple exponential functions.

&lt;page_number&gt;SECONDARY MATHEMATICS 1 | 6&lt;/page_number&gt;
<footer>ADA Compliant May 2021</footer>

## Page 17

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for MATHEMATICS

*   **Standard A.CED.2** Create equations in two or more variables to represent relationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.
*   **Standard A.CED.3** Represent constraints by equations or inequalities and by systems of equations and/or inequalities, and interpret solutions as viable or non-viable options in a modeling context. *For example, represent inequalities describing nutritional and cost constraints on combinations of different foods.*
*   **Standard A.CED.4** Rearrange formulas to highlight a quantity of interest, using the same reasoning as in solving equations. *For example, rearrange Ohm’s Law V = IR to highlight resistance R.*

## Strand: ALGEBRA—Reasoning With Equations and Inequalities (A.REI)

Understand solving equations as a process of reasoning and explain the reasoning (**Standard A.REI.1**). Solve equations and inequalities in one variable (**Standard A.REI.3**). Solve systems of equations. Build on student experiences graphing and solving systems of linear equations from middle school. Include cases where the two equations describe the same line—yielding infinitely many solutions—and cases where two equations describe parallel lines—yielding no solution; connect to GPE.5, which requires students to prove the slope criteria for parallel lines (**Standards A.REI.5–6**). Represent and solve equations and inequalities graphically (**Standards A.REI.10–12**).

*   **Standard A.REI.1** Explain each step in solving a linear equation as following from the equality of numbers asserted at the previous step, starting from the assumption that the original equation has a solution. Construct a viable argument to justify a solution method. Students will solve exponential equations with logarithms in Secondary Mathematics III.
*   **Standard A.REI.3** Solve equations and inequalities in one variable.
    *   a. Solve one-variable equations and literal equations to highlight a variable of interest.
    *   b. Solve compound inequalities in one variable, including absolute value inequalities.
    *   c. Solve simple exponential equations that rely only on application of the laws of exponents (limit solving exponential equations to those that can be solved without logarithms). *For example, 5^x = 125 or 2^x = 1/16.*
*   **Standard A.REI.5** Prove that, given a system of two equations in two variables, replacing one equation by the sum of that equation and a multiple of the other produces a system with the same solutions.
*   **Standard A.REI.6** Solve systems of linear equations exactly and approximately (numerically, algebraically, graphically), focusing on pairs of linear equations in two variables.
*   **Standard A.REI.10** Understand that the graph of an equation in two variables is the set of all its solutions plotted in the coordinate plane, often forming a curve (which could be a line).

## Page 18

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for MATHEMATICS

*   **Standard A.REI.11** Explain why the x-coordinates of the points where the graphs of the equations y = f(x) and y = g(x) intersect are the solutions of the equation f(x) = g(x); find the solutions approximately; e.g., using technology to graph the functions, make tables of values, or find successive approximations. Include cases where f(x) and/or g(x) are linear and exponential functions. ★
*   **Standard A.REI.12** Graph the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables as a half-plane (excluding the boundary in the case of a strict inequality), and graph the solution set to a system of linear inequalities in two variables as the intersection of the corresponding half-planes.

## Strand: FUNCTIONS—Interpreting Linear and Exponential Functions (F.IF)

Understand the concept of a linear or exponential function and use function notation. Recognize arithmetic and geometric sequences as examples of linear and exponential functions (Standards F.IF.1–3). Interpret linear or exponential functions that arise in applications in terms of a context (Standards F.IF.4–6). Analyze linear or exponential functions using different representations (Standards F.IF.7, 9).

*   **Standard F.IF.1** Understand that a function from one set (called the domain) to another set (called the range) assigns to each element of the domain exactly one element of the range. If f is a function and x is an element of its domain, then f(x) denotes the output of f corresponding to the input x. The graph of f is the graph of the equation y = f(x).
*   **Standard F.IF.2** Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their domains, and interpret statements that use function notation in terms of a context.
*   **Standard F.IF.3** Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers. Emphasize arithmetic and geometric sequences as examples of linear and exponential functions. For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by f(0) = f(1) = 1, f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1) for n ≥ 1.
*   **Standard F.IF.4** For a function that models a relationship between two quantities, interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities, and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description of the relationship. Key features include intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums and minimums; symmetries; and end behavior. ★
*   **Standard F.IF.5** Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable, to the quantitative relationship it describes. For example, if the function h(n) gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in a factory, then the positive integers would be an appropriate domain for the function. ★
*   **Standard F.IF.6** Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function (presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph. ★
*   **Standard F.IF.7** Graph functions expressed symbolically and show key features of the

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for MATHEMATICS

graph, by hand in simple cases and using technology for more complicated cases.★

a. Graph linear functions and show intercepts.

e. Graph exponential functions, showing intercepts and end behavior.

■ **Standard F.IF.9** Compare properties of two functions, each represented in a different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by verbal descriptions). For example, compare the growth of two linear functions, or two exponential functions such as y=3^n and y=100•2^n.

## Strand: FUNCTIONS—Building Linear or Exponential Functions (F.BF)

Build a linear or exponential function that models a relationship between two quantities (Standards F.BF.1–2). Build new functions from existing functions (Standard F.BF.3).

■ **Standard F.BF.1** Write a function that describes a relationship between two quantities.★

a. Determine an explicit expression, a recursive process, or steps for calculation from a context.

b. Combine standard function types using arithmetic operations. For example, build a function that models the temperature of a cooling body by adding a constant function to a decaying exponential, and relate these functions to the model.

■ **Standard F.BF.2** Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and translate between the two forms. Limit to linear and exponential functions. Connect arithmetic sequences to linear functions and geometric sequences to exponential functions. ★

■ **Standard F.BF.3** Identify the effect on the graph of replacing f(x) by f(x) + k, for specific values of k (both positive and negative); find the value of k given the graphs. Relate the vertical translation of a linear function to its y-intercept. Experiment with cases and illustrate an explanation of the effects on the graph using technology.

## Strand: FUNCTIONS—Linear and Exponential (F.LE)

Construct and compare linear and exponential models and solve problems (Standards F.LE.1–3). Interpret expressions for functions in terms of the situation they model. (Standard F.LE.5).

■ **Standard F.LE.1** Distinguish between situations that can be modeled with linear functions and with exponential functions.

a. Prove that linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals; exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals.

b. Recognize situations in which one quantity changes at a constant rate per unit interval relative to another.

&lt;page_number&gt;SECONDARY MATHEMATICS I | 9&lt;/page_number&gt;

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for MATHEMATICS

c. Recognize situations in which a quantity grows or decays by a constant percent rate per unit interval relative to another.

*   **Standard F.LE.2** Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table).

*   **Standard F.LE.3** Observe using graphs and tables that a quantity increasing exponentially eventually exceeds a quantity increasing linearly.

*   **Standard F.LE.5** Interpret the parameters in a linear or exponential function in terms of a context. Limit exponential functions to those of the form $f(x) = b^x + k$.

## Strand: GEOMETRY—Congruence (G.CO)

Experiment with transformations in the plane. Build on student experience with rigid motions from earlier grades (Standards G.CO.1–5). Understand congruence in terms of rigid motions. Rigid motions are at the foundation of the definition of congruence. Reason from the basic properties of rigid motions (that they preserve distance and angle), which are assumed without proof. Rigid motions and their assumed properties can be used to establish the usual triangle congruence criteria, which can then be used to prove other theorems (Standards G.CO.6–8). Make geometric constructions (Standards G.CO.12–13).

*   **Standard G.CO.1** Know precise definitions of angle, circle, perpendicular line, parallel line, and line segment, based on the undefined notions of point, line, distance along a line, and distance around a circular arc.

*   **Standard G.CO.2** Represent transformations in the plane using, for example, transparencies and geometry software; describe transformations as functions that take points in the plane as inputs and give other points as outputs. Compare transformations that preserve distance and angle to those that do not (e.g., translation versus horizontal stretch).

*   **Standard G.CO.3** Given a rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid, or regular polygon, describe the rotations and reflections that carry it onto itself.

*   **Standard G.CO.4** Develop definitions of rotations, reflections, and translations in terms of angles, circles, perpendicular lines, parallel lines, and line segments.

*   **Standard G.CO.5** Given a geometric figure and a rotation, reflection, or translation, draw the transformed figure using, for example, graph paper, tracing paper, or geometry software. Specify a sequence of transformations that will carry a given figure onto another. Point out the basis of rigid motions in geometric concepts, for example, translations move points a specified distance along a line parallel to a specified line; rotations move objects along a circular arc with a specified center through a specified angle.

*   **Standard G.CO.6** Use geometric descriptions of rigid motions to transform figures and to predict the effect of a given rigid motion on a given figure; given two figures, use

# SECONDARY MATHEMATICS II

**THE FOCUS OF SECONDARY MATHEMATICS II** is on quadratic expressions, equations, and functions and on comparing their characteristics and behavior to those of linear and exponential relationships from Secondary Mathematics I as organized into six critical areas, or units. The need for extending the set of rational numbers arises, and real and complex numbers are introduced so that all quadratic equations can be solved. The link between probability and data is explored through conditional probability and counting methods, including their use in making and evaluating decisions. The study of similarity leads to an understanding of right triangle trigonometry and connects to quadratics through Pythagorean relationships. Circles, with their quadratic algebraic representations, round out the course. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations.

**CRITICAL AREA 1:** Students extend the laws of exponents to rational exponents and explore distinctions between rational and irrational numbers by considering their decimal representations. Students learn that when quadratic equations do not have real solutions the number system must be extended so that solutions exist, analogous to the way in which extending the whole numbers to the negative numbers allows x+1 = 0 to have a solution. Students explore relationships between number systems: whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers. The guiding principle is that equations with no solutions in one number system may have solutions in a larger number system.

**CRITICAL AREA 2:** Students consider quadratic functions, comparing the key characteristics of quadratic functions to those of linear and exponential functions. They select from among these functions to model phenomena. Students learn to anticipate the graph of a quadratic function by interpreting various forms of quadratic expressions. In particular, they identify the real solutions of a quadratic equation as the zeros of a related quadratic function. When quadratic equations do not have real solutions, students learn that the graph of the related quadratic function does not cross the horizontal axis. They expand their experience with functions to include more specialized functions—absolute value, step, and those that are piecewise-defined.

**CRITICAL AREA 3:** Students begin this unit by focusing on the structure of expressions, rewriting expressions to clarify and reveal aspects of the relationship they represent. They create and solve equations, inequalities, and systems of equations involving exponential and quadratic expressions.

**CRITICAL AREA 4:** Building on probability concepts that began in the middle grades, students use the languages of set theory to expand their ability to compute and interpret theoretical and experimental probabilities for compound events, attending to mutually exclusive events, independent events, and conditional probability. Students should make use of geometric probability models wherever possible. They use probability to make informed decisions.

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for MATHEMATICS

## CRITICAL AREA 5:
Students apply their earlier experience with dilations and proportional reasoning to build a formal understanding of similarity. They identify criteria for similarity of triangles, use similarity to solve problems, and apply similarity in right triangles to understand right triangle trigonometry, with particular attention to special right triangles and the Pythagorean Theorem. It is in this unit that students develop facility with geometric proof. They use what they know about congruence and similarity to prove theorems involving lines, angles, triangles, and other polygons. They explore a variety of formats for writing proofs.

## CRITICAL AREA 6:
Students prove basic theorems about circles, such as a tangent line is perpendicular to a radius, inscribed angle theorem, and theorems about chords, secants, and tangents dealing with segment lengths and angle measures. In the Cartesian coordinate system, students use the distance formula to write the equation of a circle when given the radius and the coordinates of its center, and the equation of a parabola with vertical axis when given an equation of its directrix and the coordinates of its focus. Given an equation of a circle, they draw the graph in the coordinate plane, and apply techniques for solving quadratic equations to determine intersections between lines and circles or a parabola and between two circles. Students develop informal arguments justifying common formulas for circumference, area, and volume of geometric objects, especially those related to circles.

## Strand: MATHEMATICAL PRACTICES (MP)

The Standards for Mathematical Practice in Secondary Mathematics II describe mathematical habits of mind that teachers should seek to develop in their students. Students become mathematically proficient in engaging with mathematical content and concepts as they learn, experience, and apply these skills and attitudes (Standards MP.1–8).

*   **Standard SII.MP.1** Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. Explain the meaning of a problem and look for entry points to its solution. Analyze givens, constraints, relationships, and goals. Make conjectures about the form and meaning of the solution, plan a solution pathway, and continually monitor progress asking, “Does this make sense?” Consider analogous problems, make connections between multiple representations, identify the correspondence between different approaches, look for trends, and transform algebraic expressions to highlight meaningful mathematics. Check answers to problems using a different method.

*   **Standard SII.MP.2** Reason abstractly and quantitatively. Make sense of the quantities and their relationships in problem situations. Translate between context and algebraic representations by contextualizing and decontextualizing quantitative relationships. This includes the ability to decontextualize a given situation, representing it algebraically and manipulating symbols fluently as well as the ability to contextualize algebraic representations to make sense of the problem.

*   **Standard SII.MP.3** Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. Understand and use stated assumptions, definitions, and previously established results in constructing arguments. Make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the truth of their conjectures. Justify conclusions and communicate them to others. Respond to the arguments of others by listening, asking clarifying questions, and critiquing the reasoning of others.

*   **Standard SII.MP.4** Model with mathematics. Apply mathematics to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. Make assumptions and approximations, identifying important quantities to construct a mathematical model. Routinely interpret mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on whether the results make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not served its purpose.

*   **Standard SII.MP.5** Use appropriate tools strategically. Consider the available tools and be sufficiently familiar with them to make sound decisions about when each tool might be helpful, recognizing both the insight to be gained as well as the limitations. Identify relevant external mathematical resources and use them to pose or solve problems. Use tools to explore and deepen their understanding of concepts.

*   **Standard SII.MP.6** Attend to precision. Communicate precisely to others. Use explicit definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning. They state the meaning of the symbols they choose. Specify units of measure and label axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. Calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of precision appropriate for the problem context.

*   **Standard SII.MP.7** Look for and make use of structure. Look closely at mathematical relationships to identify the underlying structure by recognizing a simple structure within a more complicated structure. See complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as being composed of several objects. *For example, see 5 – 3(x – y)² as 5 minus a positive number times a square and use that to realize that its value cannot be more than 5 for any real numbers x and y.*

*   **Standard SII.MP.8** Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning. Notice if reasoning is repeated, and look for both generalizations and shortcuts. Evaluate the reasonableness of intermediate results by maintaining oversight of the process while attending to the details.

## Strand: NUMBER AND QUANTITY—The Real Number System (N.RN)

Extend the properties of exponents to rational exponents (Standards N.RN.1–2). Use properties of rational and irrational numbers (Standard N.RN. 3).

*   **Standard N.RN.1** Explain how the definition of the meaning of rational exponents follows from extending the properties of integer exponents to those values, allowing for a notation for radicals in terms of rational exponents. *For example, we define 5¹/³ to be the cube root of 5 because we want (5¹/³)³ = 5(¹/³)³ to hold, so (5¹/³)³ must equal 5.*

*   **Standard N.RN.2** Rewrite expressions involving radicals and rational exponents using the properties of exponents.

*   **Standard N.RN.3** Explain why sums and products of rational numbers are rational, that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational, and that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational. Connect to physical situations (e.g., finding the perimeter of a square of area 2).

## Strand: NUMBER AND QUANTITY—The Complex Number System (N.CN)

Perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers (Standards N.CN.1–2). Use complex numbers in polynomial identities and equations (Standards N.CN.7–9).

*   **Standard N.CN.1** Know there is a complex number $i$ such that $i^2 = -1$, and every complex number has the form $a + bi$ with $a$ and $b$ real.

*   **Standard N.CN.2** Use the relation $i^2 = -1$ and the commutative, associative, and distributive properties to add, subtract, and multiply complex numbers. Limit to multiplications that involve $i^2$ as the highest power of $i$.

*   **Standard N.CN.7** Solve quadratic equations with real coefficients that have complex solutions.

*   **Standard N.CN.8** Extend polynomial identities to the complex numbers. Limit to quadratics with real coefficients. *For example, rewrite $x^2 + 4$ as $(x + 2i)(x - 2i)$.*

# SECONDARY MATHEMATICS III

IN SECONDARY MATHEMATICS III students pull together and apply the accumulation of learning that they have from their previous courses, with content grouped into four critical areas, organized into units. They apply methods from probability and statistics to draw inferences and conclusions from data. Students expand their repertoire of functions to include polynomial, rational, and radical functions. They expand their study of right triangle trigonometry to include general triangles. And, finally, students bring together all of their experience with functions and geometry to create models and solve contextual problems. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations.

**CRITICAL AREA 1:** Students see how the visual displays and summary statistics they learned in earlier grades relate to different types of data and to probability distributions. They identify different ways of collecting data—including sample surveys, experiments, and simulations—and the role that randomness and careful design play in the conclusions that can be drawn.

**CRITICAL AREA 2:** This area develops the structural similarities between the system of polynomials and the system of integers. Students draw on analogies between polynomial arithmetic and base-ten computation, focusing on properties of operations, particularly the distributive property. Students connect multiplication of polynomials with multiplication of multi-digit integers, and division of polynomials with long division of integers. Students identify zeros of polynomials and make connections between zeros of polynomials and solutions of polynomial equations. The unit culminates with the fundamental theorem of algebra. Rational numbers extend the arithmetic of integers by allowing division by all numbers except 0. Similarly, rational expressions extend the arithmetic of polynomials by allowing division by all polynomials except the zero polynomial. A central theme of this unit is that the arithmetic of rational expressions is governed by the same rules as the arithmetic of rational numbers.

**CRITICAL AREA 3:** Students develop the Laws of Sines and Cosines in order to find missing measures of general (not necessarily right) triangles. They are able to distinguish whether three given measures (angles or sides) define 0, 1, 2, or infinitely many triangles. This discussion of general triangles opens up the idea of trigonometry applied beyond the right triangle—that is, at least to obtuse angles. Students build on this idea to develop the notion of radian measure for angles and extend the domain of the trigonometric functions to all real numbers. They apply this knowledge to model simple periodic phenomena.

**CRITICAL AREA 4:** Students synthesize and generalize what they have learned about a variety of function families. They extend their work with exponential functions to include solving exponential equations with logarithms. They explore the effects of transformations on graphs of diverse functions, including functions arising in an application, in order to abstract the general principle that transformations on a graph

always have the same effect regardless of the type of the underlying functions. They identify appropriate types of functions to model a situation, adjust parameters to improve the model, and compare models by analyzing the appropriateness of the fit and making judgments about the domain over which a model is a good fit. The description of modeling as “the process of choosing and using mathematics and statistics to analyze empirical situations, to understand them better, and to make decisions” is at the heart of this area. The narrative discussion and diagram of the modeling cycle should be considered when knowledge of functions, statistics, and geometry is applied in a modeling context.

## Strand: MATHEMATICAL PRACTICES (MP)

The Standards for Mathematical Practice in Secondary Mathematics III describe mathematical habits of mind that teachers should seek to develop in their students. Students become mathematically proficient in engaging with mathematical content and concepts as they learn, experience, and apply these skills and attitudes (Standards MP.1–8).

*   **Standard SIII.MP.1 Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.** Explain the meaning of a problem and look for entry points to its solution. Analyze givens, constraints, relationships, and goals. Make conjectures about the form and meaning of the solution, plan a solution pathway, and continually monitor progress asking, “Does this make sense?” Consider analogous problems, make connections between multiple representations, identify the correspondence between different approaches, look for trends, and transform algebraic expressions to highlight meaningful mathematics. Check answers to problems using a different method.

*   **Standard SIII.MP.2 Reason abstractly and quantitatively.** Make sense of the quantities and their relationships in problem situations. Translate between context and algebraic representations by contextualizing and decontextualizing quantitative relationships. This includes the ability to decontextualize a given situation, representing it algebraically and manipulating symbols fluently as well as the ability to contextualize algebraic representations to make sense of the problem.

*   **Standard SIII.MP.3 Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.** Understand and use stated assumptions, definitions, and previously established results in constructing arguments. Make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the truth of their conjectures. Justify conclusions and communicate them to others. Respond to the arguments of others by listening, asking clarifying questions, and critiquing the reasoning of others.

*   **Standard SIII.MP.4 Model with mathematics.** Apply mathematics to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. Make assumptions and approximations, identifying important quantities to construct a mathematical model. Routinely interpret mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on whether the results make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not served its purpose.

*   **Standard SIII.MP.5 Use appropriate tools strategically.** Consider the available tools and be sufficiently familiar with them to make sound decisions about when each tool might be helpful, recognizing both the insight to be gained as well as the limitations. Identify relevant external mathematical resources and use them to pose or solve problems. Use tools to explore and deepen their understanding of concepts.

*   **Standard SIII.MP.6 Attend to precision.** Communicate precisely to others. Use explicit definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning. They state the meaning of the symbols they choose. Specify units of measure and label axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. Calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of precision appropriate for the problem context.

## Strand: MATHEMATICAL PRACTICES (MP)

The Standards for Mathematical Practice in PreCalculus describe mathematical habits of mind that teachers should seek to develop in their students. Students become mathematically proficient in engaging with mathematical content and concepts as they learn, experience, and apply these skills and attitudes (Standards MP.1–8).

*   **Standard P.MP.1** Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. Explain the meaning of a problem and look for entry points to its solution. Analyze givens, constraints, relationships, and goals. Make conjectures about the form and meaning of the solution, plan a solution pathway, and continually monitor progress asking, “Does this make sense?” Consider analogous problems, make connections between multiple representations, identify the correspondence between different approaches, look for trends, and transform algebraic expressions to highlight meaningful mathematics. Check answers to problems using a different method.

*   **Standard P.MP.2** Reason abstractly and quantitatively. Make sense of the quantities and their relationships in problem situations. Translate between context and algebraic representations by contextualizing and decontextualizing quantitative relationships. This includes the ability to decontextualize a given situation, representing it algebraically and manipulating symbols fluently as well as the ability to contextualize algebraic representations to make sense of the problem.

*   **Standard P.MP.3** Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. Understand and use stated assumptions, definitions, and previously established results in constructing arguments. Make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the truth of their conjectures. Justify conclusions and communicate them to others. Respond to the arguments of others by listening, asking clarifying questions, and critiquing the reasoning of others.

*   **Standard P.MP.4** Model with mathematics. Apply mathematics to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. Make assumptions and approximations, identifying important quantities to construct a mathematical model. Routinely interpret mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on whether the results make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not served its purpose.

*   **Standard P.MP.5** Use appropriate tools strategically. Consider the available tools and be sufficiently familiar with them to make sound decisions about when each tool might be helpful, recognizing both the insight to be gained as well as the limitations. Identify relevant external mathematical resources and use them to pose or solve problems. Use tools to explore and deepen their understanding of concepts.

*   **Standard P.MP.6** Attend to precision. Communicate precisely to others. Use explicit definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning. They state the meaning of the symbols they choose. Specify units of measure and label axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. Calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of precision appropriate for the problem context.

- **Standard P.MP.7** Look for and make use of structure. Look closely at mathematical relationships to identify the underlying structure by recognizing a simple structure within a more complicated structure. See complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as being composed of several objects. *For example, see 5 – 3(x – y)² as 5 minus a positive number times a square and use that to realize that its value cannot be more than 5 for any real numbers x and y.*

- **Standard P.MP.8** Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning. Notice if reasoning is repeated, and look for both generalizations and shortcuts. Evaluate the reasonableness of intermediate results by maintaining oversight of the process while attending to the details.

    - c. Understand vector subtraction v – w as v + (–w), where –w is the additive inverse of w, with the same magnitude as w and pointing in the opposite direction. Represent vector subtraction graphically by connecting the tips in the appropriate order, and perform vector subtraction component-wise.

- **Standard N.VM.5** Multiply a vector by a scalar.
    - a. Represent scalar multiplication graphically by scaling vectors and possibly reversing their direction; perform scalar multiplication component-wise, e.g., as c(vx, vy) = (cvx, cvy).
