UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for EARLY LEARNING
"Learning opportunities occur during play and through developmentally appropriate practices. Effective teachers design play activities with specific learning goals in mind. They provide individualized, intentional, and differentiated instruction to facilitate student success. Teachers should model kindness and respect as they guide children's behavior.
Children learn in diverse ways. Early childhood professionals need to communicate with families and review classroom data and observations to identify each student's strengths and needs. Teachers should use this information to guide their instruction and make adaptations as needed.
Early childhood programs should welcome all children regardless of their ability, culture, language, or background. Effective educators create opportunities for their students to explore and discuss their unique individual characteristics, experiences, and personal backgrounds through social engagement with their classmates and teachers. Through these activities, students gain an understanding that every person has value, regardless of their similarities or differences.
HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT
The Utah Early Learning Standards are organized into strands which represent significant areas of learning within age-level progressions and content areas. Each strand introduction provides an overall view of the concepts needed for foundational understanding. Each strand contains standards. A standard represents an essential element of learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.
Each of the general learning areas contains the following information:
■ Introduction to the content area
Strand
■ Strand description
■ Sub-strand and sub-strand descriptions (English Language Arts and Lifelong Learning Practices)
■ Standard(s) for three- and four-year-olds listed separately (with the exception of Science)
■ Vertical alignment of standards for three- and four-year-olds shown side-by-side
The phrase ""with prompting and support"" is included in multiple standards throughout the document. This phrase implies that the skill/standard should be emerging, and that the child should demonstrate some independence towards achieving that skill/standard. Teachers will monitor students while working on these skills to make sure they are challenging enough for growth while being mindful of students' frustration levels. Teachers may offer more support for students by providing additional time, exposure, discussions, scaffolding, and patience as they develop these skills."

ADULTS SUPPORT LEARNING IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS WHEN THEY:
Engage in conversations with children.
"Read daily from a variety of texts, including narrative and informational genres."
"Create a language- and print-rich environment, including reading, listening, writing, and dramatic play centers, eye level alphabet charts, picture/word labels, and samples of children's work. Modifications and support in children's primary language may be provided as necessary."
"Provide activities that increase phonological awareness. Phonological awareness includes phonemic awareness, onset-rime awareness, syllable awareness, and word awareness."
"Use a wide variety of media and presentation forms, including animated and engaging storytelling, pictures or drawings, posters, appropriate short multimedia presentations, drama, signs, paintings, sculptures, puppets, and hand signs."
"Sing a wide variety of songs, including those that reflect the cultural makeup of the classroom community."
"Provide a variety of texts such as menus, books, magazines, charts, record sheets, recipes, telephone directories, journals, theater programs, newspapers, maps, instruction booklets, movie or music labels, food and product labels (including those in different languages), and store flyers."
"Provide activities that increase awareness of the rhythm of language, such as clapping the syllables in children's names or other familiar words."
Provide opportunities for multiple readings/retellings of nursery rhymes or stories.
"While reading to children, ask questions about what may happen next, how the book relates to their own experiences, how the characters in the story are feeling, etc. Encourage children to re-enact stories using dramatic play or puppets."
"Supply a variety of age-appropriate writing tools and materials in all areas of the classroom, including thin short pencils, crayons, markers, whiteboards, glue sticks, magnetic letters, paintbrushes, etc."
"Model proper writing in different ways, such as writing down what children say, labeling their drawings, writing questions that could be asked of a visitor, or making a list of foods."
