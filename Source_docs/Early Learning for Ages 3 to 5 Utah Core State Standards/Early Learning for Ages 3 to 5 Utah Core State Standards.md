# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for EARLY LEARNING

&lt;img&gt;Utah State Board of Education Seal with "UTAH STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION" around the top and bottom, a flame-like symbol in the center, and "1896" at the bottom.&lt;/img&gt;

The Utah State Board of Education, in January of 1984, established policy requiring the identification of specific core standards to be met by all preschool–12 students in order to graduate from Utah’s secondary schools. The Utah State Board of Education regularly updates the Utah Core Standards, while parents, teachers, and local school boards continue to control the curriculum choices that reflect local values.

The Utah Core Standards are aligned to scientifically based content standards. They drive high quality instruction through statewide comprehensive expectations for all students. The standards outline essential knowledge, concepts, and skills to be mastered at each grade level or within a critical content area. The standards provide a foundation for ensuring learning within the classroom.

UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for EARLY LEARNING

# INTRODUCTION

The purpose of the Utah Early Learning Standards: Ages 3 to 5 (2023) wdocument is to give administrators, early childhood professionals, and families of preschool-aged students guidance and resources regarding developmentally appropriate standards and goals for young children and students. Early childhood education is comprehensive and promotes cognitive, physical, language, and social emotional development. These standards foster school readiness and build a foundation for later academic and social success.

The Early Learning Standards have been written by multiple experts in the field of early childhood development and are designed to be inclusive of all children. Educators should be responsive to children’s current strengths, knowledge, and skills when planning and creating experiences to support learning while also being cognizant of the background and specific needs of each child. The following content areas are included in the standards:

*   English Language Arts
*   Fine Arts
*   Health Education
*   Lifelong Learning Practices
*   Mathematics
*   Physical Education
*   Science
*   Social Studies

The implementation of these Standards in early childhood programs will improve kindergarten readiness and reduce achievement gaps. The standards should not be used to exclude children from entering kindergarten. Related concepts may be added when appropriate to assure that every child reaches their potential.

## GUIDING PRINCIPLES &lt;img&gt;A cartoon dog with a blue hat.&lt;/img&gt;

Through play, relationships, and instruction, early learning provides children with an opportunity to develop skills and knowledge across all content areas. By guiding and empowering young children through positive experiences, they begin to develop responsibility, persistence, citizenship, communication skills, reasoning, effective questioning, and more.

Young children’s minds grow and develop at an extremely rapid rate. Each child is complex and has various needs. It is critical to consider the whole child and foster social, intellectual, emotional, physical, and language development. Children must feel physically and emotionally safe and secure for effective learning to take place.

Learning occurs long before children begin school. Parents and families are the first and most important teachers in a child’s life. Strong partnerships between schools and families foster positive relationships and learning at home.

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for EARLY LEARNING

Learning opportunities occur during play and through developmentally appropriate practices. Effective teachers design play activities with specific learning goals in mind. They provide individualized, intentional, and differentiated instruction to facilitate student success. Teachers should model kindness and respect as they guide children’s behavior.

Children learn in diverse ways. Early childhood professionals need to communicate with families and review classroom data and observations to identify each student’s strengths and needs. Teachers should use this information to guide their instruction and make adaptations as needed.

Early childhood programs should welcome all children regardless of their ability, culture, language, or background. Effective educators create opportunities for their students to explore and discuss their unique individual characteristics, experiences, and personal backgrounds through social engagement with their classmates and teachers. Through these activities, students gain an understanding that every person has value, regardless of their similarities or differences.

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

The Utah Early Learning Standards are organized into **strands** which represent significant areas of learning within age-level progressions and content areas. Each strand introduction provides an overall view of the concepts needed for foundational understanding. Each strand contains **standards**. A standard represents an essential element of learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.

Each of the general learning areas contains the following information:

*   Introduction to the content area
*   Strand
*   Strand description
*   Sub-strand and sub-strand descriptions (English Language Arts and Lifelong Learning Practices)
*   Standard(s) for three- and four-year-olds listed separately (with the exception of Science)
*   Vertical alignment of standards for three- and four-year-olds shown side-by-side

The phrase “with prompting and support” is included in multiple standards throughout the document. This phrase implies that the skill/standard should be emerging, and that the child should demonstrate some independence towards achieving that skill/standard. Teachers will monitor students while working on these skills to make sure they are challenging enough for growth while being mindful of students’ frustration levels. Teachers may offer more support for students by providing additional time, exposure, discussions, scaffolding, and patience as they develop these skills.

# ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS

## INTRODUCTION

Literacy is the ability to read, write, speak, and listen. When students utilize these skills, they begin to express and understand ideas and opinions, make decisions, solve problems, and achieve goals. Achieving literacy is a lifelong learning process. Literacy enables students to participate fully in their community and society.

Language is the basis for understanding and communicating in most aspects of life. Language development begins in infancy, and by the preschool years, many children have a vocabulary that includes several thousand words and continues to increase remarkably. One of the best predictors of reading success is the number of spoken words preschoolers understand and use. In fact, the number of words that young children hear along with the types of language interactions they have are significantly correlated to their academic achievement in later years (Walker, Greenwood, Hart & Carta, 1994).

Research has supported evidence-based literacy practices using systematic, explicit, sequential, and cumulative instruction when teaching the seven essential components of literacy: oral language, phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, comprehension, and writing. According to research, it is recommended that preschool teachers prepare children for later reading instruction. They can do so by introducing the five critical building blocks for literacy, including phonological awareness, letter identification, vocabulary knowledge, print concepts, and a positive attitude toward reading (Henry, 2019). The lack of phonemic awareness is the most powerful determinant of the likelihood of failure to read (Adams, 1998). Early phonological awareness skills usually develop during preschool ages and include rhyming, alliteration, segmenting words into syllables, and identifying the first sounds in words. Research suggests these early phonological awareness skills facilitate the development of letter-sound knowledge (Cardos-Martins et al., 2011). The levels of phonological awareness can build on each other, advancing from word awareness to syllable awareness, to onset-rime awareness, to individual phoneme awareness. “Children’s language develops on a continuum and moves from large to increasingly smaller segments of language” (Cunningham & Zibulsky, 2014). Teaching strategies used not only need to be systematic and explicit, but they need to be developmentally appropriate and “framed within playful learning and intentional play” (Paulson & Moats, 2018).

## ADULTS SUPPORT LEARNING IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS WHEN THEY:

*   Engage in conversations with children.
*   Read daily from a variety of texts, including narrative and informational genres.
*   Create a language- and print-rich environment, including reading, listening, writing, and dramatic play centers, eye level alphabet charts, picture/word labels, and samples of children’s work. Modifications and support in children’s primary language may be provided as necessary.
*   Provide activities that increase phonological awareness. Phonological awareness includes phonemic awareness, onset-rime awareness, syllable awareness, and word awareness.
*   Use a wide variety of media and presentation forms, including animated and engaging storytelling, pictures or drawings, posters, appropriate short multimedia presentations, drama, signs, paintings, sculptures, puppets, and hand signs.
*   Sing a wide variety of songs, including those that reflect the cultural makeup of the classroom community.
*   Provide a variety of texts such as menus, books, magazines, charts, record sheets, recipes, telephone directories, journals, theater programs, newspapers, maps, instruction booklets, movie or music labels, food and product labels (including those in different languages), and store flyers.
*   Provide activities that increase awareness of the rhythm of language, such as clapping the syllables in children’s names or other familiar words.
*   Provide opportunities for multiple readings/retellings of nursery rhymes or stories.
*   While reading to children, ask questions about what may happen next, how the book relates to their own experiences, how the characters in the story are feeling, etc. Encourage children to re-enact stories using dramatic play or puppets.
*   Supply a variety of age-appropriate writing tools and materials in all areas of the classroom, including thin short pencils, crayons, markers, whiteboards, glue sticks, magnetic letters, paintbrushes, etc.
*   Model proper writing in different ways, such as writing down what children say, labeling their drawings, writing questions that could be asked of a visitor, or making a list of foods.

## INTRODUCTION

Children use creativity to explore, discover, and make sense of the world around them. As outlined in the Utah State Standards, the study of drama, dance, music, and visual arts provide a venue for creativity to flourish. Fine Arts provide opportunities for children to explore realities, relationships, and ideas that cannot be learned or demonstrated simply in words or numbers.

Learning in Fine Arts is valuable for building curiosity and supporting children in expressing and communicating their ideas and experiences. Additionally, integrating the arts throughout the classroom supports children’s engagement in cooperative learning and constructing knowledge in all content areas:

*   Visual arts instruction improves reading readiness.
*   Musical experiences support understanding foundational mathematical concepts.
*   Engaging in fine arts reduces children’s stress and increases their cognition, self-awareness, self-direction, social and cultural awareness, independence, language skills, physical and social-emotional development, and ability to make sense of the world around them.

Collaboration, creativity, and cultural awareness are essential skills and concepts for children to develop and explore in our global environment. Nurturing and integrating these skills and concepts provide the foundation for children’s lifelong educational success.

## ADULTS SUPPORT LEARNING IN FINE ARTS WHEN THEY:

*   Encourage conversation to help children express their ideas, emotions, and understanding in a variety of ways.
*   Gain an understanding of children’s preferences, interests, backgrounds, and culture to develop instruction and create an engaging learning environment.
*   Encourage children to observe, interpret, and understand the expression of others.
*   Provide opportunities for children to work collaboratively with others.
*   Support children’s self-awareness by providing opportunities for children to display, perform, and discuss their creative works.
*   Engage and follow the children’s lead in creative processes.
*   Acknowledge children’s efforts and persistence in artistic expression.

# HEALTH EDUCATION &lt;img&gt;A cartoon child with a pencil.&lt;/img&gt;

## INTRODUCTION

The success of Utah’s young children is strongly linked to their health. The goal of Health Education is to support early childhood educators and families in developing healthy, responsible children with knowledge and skills that lead to lifelong healthy behaviors. The inclusion of health practices in a child’s education positively contributes to their ability to learn, focus, and achieve health and wellness throughout their lives. The Utah Early Learning Standards for Health Education are an introduction to physical, mental, emotional, and social health.

The Health Standards consist of four strands:
**Human Development** focuses on independence in personal care and hygiene. Children with experience establishing habits and routines for caring for and protecting their bodies in a developmentally appropriate way tend to have healthier growth and development (Britto et al., 2017).

**Health Foundations and Protective Factors of Healthy Self** focuses on learning characteristics of safe and healthy relationships with peers and trusted adults (for example, parent, guardian, relative, teacher, counselor, clergy). Children with experience in building strong protective factors through positive reciprocal relationships are less likely to develop mental illness or substance use disorders (Shonkoff et al., 2012).

**Mental and Emotional Health** focuses on awareness and care for the mental and emotional health of self and others. Children with experience using strategies to identify and manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors have shown to be more skilled in self-regulation and self-control (Montroy et al., 2016; Schore, 2015).

**Nutrition** focuses on understanding the importance of nutritional food on health throughout life, including food choices, such as identifying healthy or less healthy foods, and how to properly fuel the body. Proper nutrition is linked to learning readiness, academic achievement, emotional health, supporting the immune system, and reducing the occurrence of many diseases (Britto et al., 2017).

**ADULTS SUPPORT LEARNING IN HEALTH EDUCATION WHEN THEY:**

*   Encourage the child to participate in bedtime routines, including brushing their teeth, etc.
*   Provide examples of what a good friend is and is not.
*   Provide suggestions for appropriate turn taking.
*   Talk about foods in the environment and discuss healthy foods during snack time.
*   Help children acknowledge their feelings and teach them appropriate ways to handle those feelings.

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for EARLY LEARNING LIFELONG LEARNING PRACTICES

# LIFELONG LEARNING PRACTICES

## INTRODUCTION

Lifelong Learning Practices are key to student success and include skills to foster children’s social and academic interactions as well as support a child’s desire for learning. Approaches to Learning includes the concepts of curiosity, engagement, interest in learning, independence, flexibility, perseverance, imagination, and problem-solving. Social development includes self-awareness, regulation and recognition of emotions, emotional responsiveness, and the ability to interact with others effectively in social settings. These foundational skills are essential for learning success. Early childhood is a sensitive time period to acquire these lifelong learning skills (National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2007).

“There is abundant evidence that when districts and schools explicitly and meaningfully commit to focusing on the students’ comprehensive development as a central part of their academic growth, the academic success and the welfare of students rise powerfully together” (National Commission on Social, Emotional, and Academic Development, 2019). When children are actively engaged through play, exploration, and inquiry, it supports the social, emotional, physical, and academic needs of the whole child.

Learning occurs naturally through play and has many benefits for children to enhance their overall development. Play promotes joyful learning that fosters self-regulation, language, cognitive, and social competencies as well as content knowledge across disciplines and is essential for all children, birth through age 8 (Yogman, et al. (2018). All young children need daily sustained opportunities for play, both indoors and outdoors. In all its forms—including physical play, object play, pretend or dramatic play, constructive play, and games with rules—play supports children’s learning (National Association for the Education of Young Children [NAEYC] 2020).

Promoting fundamental approaches to learning and healthy social interaction prepares the architecture and development of the brain. These skills provide a foundation for optimal learning.

The Early Learning Standards support the Utah State Board of Education’s aspirations for Lifelong Learning Practices identified in Utah’s Portrait of a Graduate (2019). In the Early Learning Standards, two areas of Lifelong Learning Practices are addressed: Approaches to Learning and Social Interaction and Development.

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for EARLY LEARNING LIFELONG LEARNING PRACTICES

Approaches to Learning describes the underlying processes involved in effective learning in the early childhood years (Vitiello & Greenfield, 2017) and throughout life (McCoy et al., 2019). Engaging in learning opportunities that challenge children to advance their knowledge and skill promotes learning motivation and persistence. As children are given opportunities to joyfully engage and explore, they develop a lifelong love of learning (Hyson, 2008). As children grow, they develop increasingly organized and complex strategies for engaging and focusing attention on learning experiences, processing information, regulating behavior, and coordinating these processes to construct new knowledge (National Research Council, 2000).

The Approaches to Learning Standards provide opportunities for children to develop initiative and persistence, creativity and curiosity, and effective strategies for self-regulation.

The Social Interaction and Development Standards are essential for children’s learning success. Ho and Funk (2018) identify research suggesting that children with healthy social emotional skills “tend to be happier, show greater motivation to learn, have a more positive attitude toward school, more eagerly participate in class activities, and demonstrate higher academic performance than less mentally healthy peers.” For many children, preschool may be their first experience in a nonfamilial structured social environment. They are beginning to acquire those abilities which will allow them to become self-aware, recognize and regulate emotions, build relationships, develop social engagement, and practice conflict resolution. Although many of these skills will be learned and refined by interacting with peers, children benefit from the guidance of knowledgeable and caring adults to develop a sense of belonging.

## ADULTS SUPPORT LIFELONG LEARNING WHEN THEY:

*   Encourage balance and healthy lifestyles.
*   Teach strategies to develop critical thinking and problem solving.
*   Help children develop citizenship skills to be responsible, accountable, and helpful.
*   Create a learning environment that inspires a sense of wonder, delight, curiosity, and creativity.
*   Recognize and honor variations in cultural contexts relating to how children play and make sense of their experiences. Provide materials that are culturally relevant and inclusive of children that make up the learning community.

## LIFELONG LEARNING PRACTICES—APPROACHES TO LEARNING

In the Approaches to Learning Standards, children develop self-regulation and executive functioning, learning engagement (initiative and persistence), and creativity and curiosity.

## Strand 1: SELF-REGULATION AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING

Self-Regulation, which is the ability to regulate one's own behavior while engaging with others and in the learning environment, is a key developmental task of the preschool years. Executive Functioning includes the essential learning skills of attention focusing, working memory, information processing, and reflection.

*   **Standard LLP 3 yr.1.1** With prompting and support, begin to develop the ability to self-regulate external behaviors (for example, during music and movement, students will learn how to start and stop their own body, notice when they are tired, or need to be active).
*   **Standard LLP 3 yr.1.2** With prompting and support, begin to develop the ability to focus attention on key components of an object or task (Attention focusing, for example, follow the sequence of a story or conversation).
*   **Standard LLP 3 yr.1.3** With prompting and support, begin to develop strategies for connecting and remembering information (Working memory and information processing, for example, review the pictures on the daily schedule to see what activity comes before recess).
*   **Standard LLP 3 yr.1.4** With prompting and support, begin to develop the ability to recognize and show awareness of thinking processes (Reflection, for example, the child explains that she took a deep breath to help herself calm down).

## INTRODUCTION

Mathematics is a way of thinking about patterns, relationships, and seeking multiple solutions to problems. Children’s knowledge of math concepts and language are used in all learning domains.

Children learn mathematics best when their natural interests and curiosity are nurtured through intentional instruction. Quality learning environments should focus on actual hands-on experiences during play and interaction with others to incorporate well-designed mathematical experiences. Preschool children should experience language-rich environments that help them connect mathematical concepts, problem-solving, and reasoning skills to previous knowledge.

## ADULTS SUPPORT LEARNING IN MATHEMATICS WHEN THEY:

*   Give children adequate time to explore and experiment with manipulatives before starting teacher planned instruction.
*   Design experiences where children explore and experience their environment to identify spatial relationships such as, “How many children fit inside the castle in the outdoor area?”
*   Model and encourage correct mathematical language throughout the day.
*   Use mathematical language to extend children’s understanding within the context of their experiences, such as: “Do you want half a glass of milk or a full glass of milk?” or “Would you like more or fewer grapes than I have?”
*   Explore addition and subtraction, and compare objects using measurable attributes (length, width, or size) in the context of classroom play or teacher-guided activities.
*   Integrate mathematical experiences, including stories, chants, and songs to reinforce mathematical concepts such as “Five Little Speckled Frogs,” “Five Little Ducks,” and “The Three Billy Goats Gruff.”
*   Provide a variety of manipulatives and materials in math centers.
*   Integrate mathematics throughout the day (for example, counting snacks, identifying shapes, ordering objects by length or size).
*   Design home experiences to incorporate math skills (for example, count steps from the bed to the door, count chairs, find shapes in furniture, find patterns in the tablecloth).
*   Use a variety of tools to incorporate mathematical concepts (for example, water table, sandbox, modeling clay, blocks).

## INTRODUCTION

The goal of physical education is to develop healthy, responsible children who have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to work together, think critically, and participate in a variety of activities that lead to a lifelong healthy lifestyle. Physical development is integral to building children's self-esteem, confidence, fitness, and well-being. Research tells us that children who are physically active for 60 minutes a day (24 hours), are healthier, have higher self-confidence, learn more effectively, and are less likely to be absent (National Association for Sport and Physical Education [NASPE], 2011). As children refine their physical movements, they develop higher-order thinking skills that are necessary for future social and academic success. Children develop life skills through participation in cooperative and competitive activity.

Quality physical education utilizes developmentally appropriate experiences to develop competence and confidence in a variety of activities such as sports, dance, outdoor recreation, and physical fitness. The emphasis should be on providing success and enjoyment for all children. Children need well-rounded playtime with opportunities to develop both gross (large) and fine (small) motor control.

### Definitions:

*   Motor skills are defined as both small muscle and large muscle movements.
    *   Gross (large) motor skills, including walking, kicking, hopping, galloping, running, sliding, skipping, leaping, and jumping, are the foundation of movement.
    *   Fine (small) motor skills, including the two-finger pincer grasp and manipulation of small objects, support the development of pre-writing skills.
*   Locomotor skills include walking, hopping, running, jumping, galloping leaping, and sliding.
*   Non-locomotor skills include balancing on one foot, moving body parts in isolation, bending, twisting, turning.

## ADULTS SUPPORT LEARNING IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION WHEN THEY:

*   Continually encourage, challenge, and strengthen children’s gross and fine motor skills by teaching, modeling, and providing many opportunities to:
    *   Run, gallop, throw, catch, hop, kick, dance, jump, climb, pull, carry, stretch, bend, twist, and move isolated parts of the body.
    *   Practice building with large and small blocks, molding clay, using scissors or tongs, stringing beads, placing pegs in holes, assembling puzzles, using a computer mouse, and using a variety of writing utensils (pencils, crayons, markers) and art mediums (painting, printing, manipulating clay, stamping).
*   Participate in fine and gross motor activities alongside the children.
*   Teach, model, and maintain proper safety rules.
*   Provide opportunities for both organized and spontaneous play.

## INTRODUCTION

These Early Learning Science Standards are aligned to the 2019 Utah’s K–12 Science and Engineering Education (SEEd) standards. The Science standards are founded on what science is, how science is learned, and the multiple dimensions of scientific work. Young children are captivated by discovering and exploring their natural world. They insist that teachers and family members answer their questions about the world around them. The questions that children ask about how insects fly, what makes a shadow, or what happens when paint colors are mixed are transformed into hypotheses about their world. They use their senses and scientific tools to observe, collect and interpret data, and draw conclusions. Communicating their findings informally in conversations or through the documentation of results leads children to ask new questions and to continue the cycle of scientific investigation.

By cultivating this sense of wonder, adults can help children to become scientific thinkers. As they learn about the world around them, including weather, light, living things, and matter and motion, young children begin to see patterns and understand the processes that affect their personal environments. Adults can support this learning by planning developmentally appropriate, experiential learning activities that allow children to utilize the Three Dimensions of Science (National Research Council, 2012).

The three dimensions of science learning help us to make sense of all that science does and represents. These include:

1. Science and Engineering Practices (What Students Do)
2. Crosscutting Concepts (How Students Think)
3. Disciplinary Core Ideas (What Students Know)

Taken together, these represent how science is used to make sense of phenomena, and they are most meaningful when learned in concert with one another.

**Science and Engineering Practices:** These practices refer to the things that scientists and engineers do and how they work. Scientists do much more than make hypotheses and test them with experiments. They engage in wonder, design, modeling, construction, communication, and collaboration.

**Crosscutting Concepts:** Understanding Crosscutting Concepts enables us to make connections among different subjects and to utilize science in diverse settings. They reach across disciplines and demonstrate how specific ideas are united into overarching principles, such as planning and carrying out investigations to determine patterns of cause and effect.

**Disciplinary Core Ideas:** Core Ideas are traditionally associated with science knowledge and specific subject areas within science. These Core Ideas are organized within physical, life, and Earth sciences.

&lt;page_number&gt;SCIENCE | 68&lt;/page_number&gt;

## Page 77

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for EARLY LEARNING SCIENCE

Each standard is framed upon the three dimensions of science to represent a cohesive, multi-faceted science learning outcome. Crosscutting Concepts are underlined throughout the standards.

Many standards contain additional emphasis and example statements. Emphasis statements highlight a required and necessary part of the student learning to satisfy that standard. Example statements help to clarify the meaning of the standard and are not required for instruction.

Early Learning Science Standards are combined into an Early Learning Band for three- and four-year-old students. Individual children’s developmental levels need to be considered when planning and implementing science learning activities.

## ADULTS SUPPORT LEARNING IN SCIENCE WHEN THEY:

*   Allow children to explore their surroundings and ask questions while they are doing so.
*   Lead children in discussions of, “What do you think will happen if...?”
*   Point out changes in children’s environment including the weather, seasons, etc.
*   Provide children with language to describe what they see, hear, touch, taste, etc.
*   Build ramps, forts, levers, etc. with children and let them discover what will happen when using them.
*   Model and support vocabulary associated with the scientific process.
*   Support children’s curiosity in their exploration of their environment by encouraging problem solving and discovery.

## STRAND 1: WEATHER

*Weather is the combination of sunlight, wind, snow, or rain, and temperature in a particular place at a particular time. Humans can plan and prepare for different weather conditions.*

☐ **Standard 3–4 yr.1.1** Obtain and communicate information about local, observable weather conditions while exploring and describing patterns found in different seasons. Emphasize the observation and recognition of data. Examples of data may include sunny, cloudy, windy, rainy, snowy, cold, or warm.

☐ **Standard 3–4 yr.1.2** Obtain and communicate information about human behavior patterns in different weather conditions. Emphasize the observation and recognition of data. Examples of data may include clothing, food, safety, and other preparations for expected weather.

## STRAND 2: LIGHT

*Sunlight has an effect on surfaces. Objects can be seen when light is available to illuminate them. Light is required for plant growth.*

☐ **Standard 3–4 yr.2.1** Plan and carry out an investigation using the five senses to determine the effect of sunlight on different surfaces and materials. Examples could include determining if the effect is hot or cold or a light or dark surface.

☐ **Standard 3–4 yr.2.2** Carry out an investigation to show the effect of light in illuminating objects. Emphasize that objects can be seen when light is available to illuminate them. Examples could include observations about light when navigating a room with the lights off compared to the lights on.

☐ **Standard 3–4yr.2.3** Plan and carry out an investigation to determine the effect of sunlight and water on plant growth. Examples could include growing plants in light or dark places.

## INTRODUCTION

The primary purpose of Social Studies is to prepare children to become informed and engaged citizens in a culturally diverse, rapidly changing, and interdependent world. Children will learn about diverse cultures, languages, and abilities as well as the importance of including all people.

For many children, preschool may be their first experience in a nonfamily, structured social environment. As such, they are beginning to acquire skills in collaboration, problem-solving, decision-making, and citizenship. Although many of these skills will be learned and refined by interacting with peers, children profit from the guidance of knowledgeable and caring adults.

As children develop relationships with their caregivers and peers, they begin to understand the social structures within their schools. As they mature, this will expand to include their communities, country, and the world. They will understand and appreciate the social structures and norms that create a community and their role as an active participant.

### ADULTS SUPPORT LEARNING IN SOCIAL STUDIES WHEN THEY:

*   Encourage regular classroom discussions.
*   Learn about children’s preferences, interests, background, and culture. Adults share information about themselves and find commonalities with children and others.
*   Honor children’s family culture and maintain a respectful attitude when interacting with others.
*   Encourage children to respect and include all classmates, appreciate differences, and meet one another’s needs.
*   Acknowledge children’s efforts and classroom contributions.
*   Provide direct instruction on appropriate social interaction skills with specific feedback.
*   Design activities that foster social interaction.
*   Model behaviors that care for the environment.
*   Explain the importance of safety and why that practice is important.
*   Provide children with choices and voting opportunities.
*   Model healthy use of technology including supporting the use of assistive technology.
*   Follow the children’s lead, play with them at their level, and encourage cooperative play.
