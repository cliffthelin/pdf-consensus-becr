Early childhood education is comprehensive and promotes cognitive, physical, language, and social emotional development. These standards foster school readiness and build a foundation for later academic and social success. The Early Learning Standards have been written by multiple experts in the field of early childhood development and are designed to be inclusive of all children. Educators should be responsive to children’s current strengths, knowledge, and skills when planning and creating experiences to support learning while also being cognizant of the background and specific needs of each child. The following content areas are included in the standards: The implementation of these Standards in early childhood programs will improve kindergarten readiness and reduce achievement gaps. The standards should not be used to exclude children from entering kindergarten. Related concepts may be added when appropriate to assure that every child reaches their potential.",

Young children’s minds grow and develop at an extremely rapid rate. Each child is complex and has various needs. It is critical to consider the whole child and foster social, intellectual, emotional, physical, and language development. Children must feel physically and emotionally safe and secure for effective learning to take place. Learning occurs long before children begin school.

While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.\n\nEach of the general learning areas contains the following information:\n\nThe phrase “with prompting and support” is included in multiple standards throughout the document. This phrase implies that the skill/standard should be emerging, and that the child should demonstrate some independence towards achieving that skill/standard. Teachers will monitor students while working on these skills to make sure they are challenging enough for growth while being mindful of students’ frustration levels. Teachers may offer more support for students by providing additional time, exposure, discussions, scaffolding, and patience as they develop these skills.",

            "content": "Literacy is the ability to read, write, speak, and listen. When students utilize these skills, they begin to express and understand ideas and opinions, make decisions, solve problems, and achieve goals. Achieving literacy is a lifelong learning process. Literacy enables students to participate fully in their community and society.\n\n&lt;img&gt;A cartoon illustration of a child with long hair, wearing a light blue jacket, sitting and reading a yellow book.&lt;/img&gt;\n\nLanguage is the basis for understanding and communicating in most aspects of life. Language development begins in infancy, and by the preschool years, many children have a vocabulary that includes several thousand words and continues to increase remarkably. One of the best predictors of reading success is the number of spoken words preschoolers understand and use. In fact, the number of words that young children hear along with the types of language interactions they have are significantly correlated to their academic achievement in later years (Walker, Greenwood, Hart & Carta, 1994).\n\nResearch has supported evidence-based literacy practices using systematic, explicit, sequential, and cumulative instruction when teaching the seven essential components of literacy: oral language, phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, comprehension, and writing. According to research, it is recommended that preschool teachers prepare children for later reading instruction. They can do so by introducing the five critical building blocks for literacy, including phonological awareness, letter identification, vocabulary knowledge, print concepts, and a positive attitude toward reading (Henry, 2019). The lack of phonemic awareness is the most powerful determinant of the likelihood of failure to read (Adams, 1998). Early phonological awareness skills usually develop during preschool ages and include rhyming, alliteration, segmenting words into syllables, and identifying the first sounds in words. Research suggests these early phonological awareness skills facilitate the development of letter-sound knowledge (Cardos-Martins et al., 2011). The levels of phonological awareness can build on each other, advancing from word awareness to syllable awareness, to onset-rime awareness, to individual phoneme awareness. “Children’s language develops on a continuum and moves from large to increasingly smaller segments of language” (Cunningham & Zibulsky, 2014). Teaching strategies used not only need to be systematic and explicit, but they need to be developmentally appropriate and “framed within playful learning and intentional play” (Paulson & Moats, 2018).",

The goal of Health Education is to support early childhood educators and families in developing healthy, responsible children with knowledge and skills that lead to lifelong healthy behaviors. The inclusion of health practices in a child’s education positively contributes to their ability to learn, focus, and achieve health and wellness throughout their lives. The Utah Early Learning Standards for Health Education are an introduction to physical, mental, emotional, and social health. The Health Standards consist of four strands: Human Development focuses on independence in personal care and hygiene. Children with experience establishing habits and routines for caring for and protecting their bodies in a developmentally appropriate way tend to have healthier growth and development (Britto et al., 2017). Health Foundations and Protective Factors of Healthy Self focuses on learning characteristics of safe and healthy relationships with peers and trusted adults (for example, parent, guardian, relative, teacher, counselor, clergy). Children with experience in building strong protective factors through positive reciprocal relationships are less likely to develop mental illness or substance use disorders (Shonkoff et al., 2012). Mental and Emotional Health focuses on awareness and care for the mental and emotional health of self and others. Children with experience using strategies to identify and manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors have shown to be more skilled in self-regulation and self-control (Montroy et al., 2016; Schore, 2015). Nutrition focuses on understanding the importance of nutritional food on health throughout life, including food choices, such as identifying healthy or less healthy foods, and how to properly fuel the body. Proper nutrition is linked to learning readiness, academic achievement, emotional health, supporting the immune system, and reducing the occurrence of many diseases (Britto et al., 2017).",

            "content": "Lifelong Learning Practices are key to student success and include skills to foster children’s social and academic interactions as well as support a child’s desire for learning. Approaches to Learning includes the concepts of curiosity, engagement, interest in learning, independence, flexibility, perseverance, imagination, and problem-solving. Social development includes self-awareness, regulation and recognition of emotions, emotional responsiveness, and the ability to interact with others effectively in social settings. These foundational skills are essential for learning success. Early childhood is a sensitive time period to acquire these lifelong learning skills (National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2007).\n\n“There is abundant evidence that when districts and schools explicitly and meaningfully commit to focusing on the students’ comprehensive development as a central part of their academic growth, the academic success and the welfare of students rise powerfully together” (National Commission on Social, Emotional, and Academic Development, 2019). When children are actively engaged through play, exploration, and inquiry, it supports the social, emotional, physical, and academic needs of the whole child.\n\nLearning occurs naturally through play and has many benefits for children to enhance their overall development. Play promotes joyful learning that fosters self-regulation, language, cognitive, and social competencies as well as content knowledge across disciplines and is essential for all children, birth through age 8 (Yogman, et al. (2018). All young children need daily sustained opportunities for play, both indoors and outdoors. In all its forms—including physical play, object play, pretend or dramatic play, constructive play, and games with rules—play supports children’s learning (National Association for the Education of Young Children [NAEYC] 2020).\n\nPromoting fundamental approaches to learning and healthy social interaction prepares the architecture and development of the brain. These skills provide a foundation for optimal learning.\n\nThe Early Learning Standards support the Utah State Board of Education’s aspirations for Lifelong Learning Practices identified in Utah’s Portrait of a Graduate (2019). In the Early Learning Standards, two areas of Lifelong Learning Practices are addressed: Approaches to Learning and Social Interaction and Development.",

As children are given opportunities to joyfully engage and explore, they develop a lifelong love of learning (Hyson, 2008). As children grow, they develop increasingly organized and complex strategies for engaging and focusing attention on learning experiences, processing information, regulating behavior, and coordinating these processes to construct new knowledge (National Research Council, 2000).\n\nThe Approaches to Learning Standards provide opportunities for children to develop initiative and persistence, creativity and curiosity, and effective strategies for self-regulation.",

They are beginning to acquire those abilities which will allow them to become self-aware, recognize and regulate emotions, build relationships, develop social engagement, and practice conflict resolution. Although many of these skills will be learned and refined by interacting with peers, children benefit from the guidance of knowledgeable and caring adults to develop a sense of belonging.",

Physical development is integral to building children's self-esteem, confidence, fitness, and well-being. Research tells us that children who are physically active for 60 minutes a day (24 hours), are healthier, have higher self-confidence, learn more effectively, and are less likely to be absent (National Association for Sport and Physical Education [NASPE], 2011). As children refine their physical movements, they develop higher-order thinking skills that are necessary for future social and academic success. Children develop life skills through participation in cooperative and competitive activity.\n\nQuality physical education utilizes developmentally appropriate experiences to develop competence and confidence in a variety of activities such as sports, dance, outdoor recreation, and physical fitness. The emphasis should be on providing success and enjoyment for all children. Children need well-rounded playtime with opportunities to develop both gross (large) and fine (small) motor control.",

Children will learn about diverse cultures, languages, and abilities as well as the importance of including all people.\n\nFor many children, preschool may be their first experience in a nonfamily, structured social environment. As such, they are beginning to acquire skills in collaboration, problem-solving, decision-making, and citizenship. Although many of these skills will be learned and refined by interacting with peers, children profit from the guidance of knowledgeable and caring adults.\n\nAs children develop relationships with their caregivers and peers, they begin to understand the social structures within their schools. As they mature, this will expand to include their communities, country, and the world. They will understand and appreciate the social structures and norms that create a community and their role as an active participant.",
