# GRAMMAR AND CONVENTIONS PROGRESSION CHART

The following table provides a suggested list of grammar and conventions for teachers to use when implementing the P-12 Utah English Language Arts Standards, specifically writing standards one through three and speaking and listening standard three. Teaching grammar and conventions is a component of overall language instruction. Therefore, this instruction needs to be embedded within contexts where students are authentically producing and consuming language (i.e., reading, writing, and speaking and listening) rather than taught as isolated skills.
