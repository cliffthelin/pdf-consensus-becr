The Utah State Board of Education, in January of 1984, established policy requiring the identification of specific core standards to be met by all K-12 students in order to graduate from Utah's secondary schools. The Utah State Board of Education regularly updates the Utah Core Standards, while parents, teachers, and local school boards continue to control the curriculum choices that reflect local values.

The Utah Core Standards are aligned to scientifically based content standards. They drive high quality instruction through statewide comprehensive expectations for all students. The standards outline essential knowledge, concepts, and skills to be mastered at each grade level or within a critical content area. The standards provide a foundation for ensuring learning within the classroom.

UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for DRIVER EDUCATION

# INTRODUCTION

America is perhaps the only nation on the earth where the automobile is widely considered essential. The automobile affects nearly every aspect of our daily lives. Few things so occupy the attention and dreams of young Americans as getting a driver license. Sadly, many of these young Americans will not escape tragic results —loss of property, injury, or even the loss of life—due to insufficient driving skills or inattention to driving conditions. Since the automobile is such a substantial part of American life, it is imperative that vehicle operators possess the requisite skill and knowledge to drive safely. This fact was recognized as early as 1955 by the Utah State Legislature, when a law was enacted which specifically authorized the Utah State Board of Education to establish standards for driver education in the state’s high schools.

The rapid growth and expansion of driver education, the emergence of innovative programs, new legislation, and the passing of the Graduated Driver Licensing laws have brought about the need to provide standards for Utah’s driver education program.

Representatives from Utah Department of Transportation Outreach Specialists, Driver License Division, Highway Safety Office, and driver education instructors met to revise the Utah driver education standards. This committee collaboratively put together the following standards, which represent essential elements of the learning that is expected. The writing committee consisted of the following participants:

*   Terrell Baldwin, Green Canyon High School
*   Kylie Christensen, Zero Fatalities
*   Steve Galley, Riverton High School
*   Sharon Harward, Driver License Division
*   Caren Johnson, Utah State Board of Education
*   Mark Larsen, Weber High School
*   Natalie Lovell, Truck Smart
*   Melinda Macfarlane, Zero Fatalities
*   Cole Meacham, Manti High School
*   Troy Nordick, Utah State Board of Education
*   Nicole Petersen, Rockwell Charter High School
*   Nichole Rilk, Driver License Division
*   Jesse Roberts, Box Elder High School
*   Allison Terry, Lone Peak High School
*   Walt Webster, Operation Lifesaver
*   Amy Winkler, Utah Highway Safety Office

## Organization of the Standards
The Utah Core Standards are organized into **strands**, which represent significant areas of learning within content areas. Depending on the core area, these strands may be designated by time periods, thematic principles, modes of practice, or other organizing principles.

Within each strand are **standards**. A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficiency to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for DRIVER EDUCATION

## STRAND 1: PARENT OR GUARDIAN INVOLVEMENT IN MODELING GOOD DRIVING HABITS

Parent or guardian involvement is a major part of the driver education process. Studies show that children who have higher parent or guardian involvement tend to be safer drivers and have fewer crashes over their lifetimes. The Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) laws require the parent or guardian to become more involved in their teen driver's learning period. Utah's GDL law was passed in 1999 and according to the Utah Department of Health; there has been a 62% decrease in the fatalities of teens age 15-17. Educating parents or guardians on their involvement with their teen's driving safety and GDL laws is imperative to the success of the novice driver.

*   **STANDARD 1.1** Students will identify and understand the current Utah GDL laws and provide evidence of a discussion about the laws with a parent or guardian.
*   **STANDARD 1.2** Students will identify and understand the steps in obtaining an original Utah driver license.
*   **STANDARD 1.3** Students will describe how emotional situations can lead to dangerous driving behaviors and provide evidence of a discussion with a parent or guardian.
*   **STANDARD 1.4** Students will describe the responsibilities of owning and operating a vehicle. These responsibilities include environmental impact, especially air quality, financial and legal responsibility, and vehicle operation and maintenance. Provide evidence of a discussion with a parent or guardian.

## STRAND 2: RULES OF THE ROAD

Understanding and obeying rules of the road is essential to the safe operation and maneuvering of a vehicle. Rules of the road include signs, signals, pavement markings, and traffic controls that students must act on while behind the wheel.

*   **STANDARD 2.1** Students will identify roadway signs by shape and color and recognize meaning.
*   **STANDARD 2.2** Students will describe the different types of traffic signals.
*   **STANDARD 2.3** Students will identify various pavement markings and recognize meaning.
*   **STANDARD 2.4** Students will describe the different rights of way.

## STRAND 3: RISK MANAGEMENT IN ALL DRIVING SITUATIONS

Risk, to some degree, is always present in any driving situation. Risk management includes understanding the concepts of proper vision, space cushion, appropriate decision-making, and defensive driving skills. Risk management also includes avoiding the five most common deadly driving behaviors: drowsy, distracted, aggressive, impaired, and not buckling up.

*   **STANDARD 3.1** Students will apply the concepts of proper vision needed to safely operate a motor vehicle.
*   **STANDARD 3.2** Students will apply the concepts of proper space cushioning needed to safely operate a motor vehicle.
*   **STANDARD 3.3** Students will understand and demonstrate effective defensive driving strategies.
*   **STANDARD 3.4** Students will analyze data that identifies the five most common deadly driving behaviors (drowsy, distracted, aggressive, impaired, and not buckling up) and describe the necessary steps drivers must take to avoid each of them.

## STRAND 4: MOTOR VEHICLE MANEUVERS AND OPERATIONS

The acquisition and development of driving skills necessary to safely maneuver and operate a motor vehicle. Maneuvers and operation include the physics of driving; especially speed in relationship to stopping, starting, turning, and all other driving maneuvers. Driver-assistance technology continues to advance. Understanding how to use these systems safely is critical.

*   **STANDARD 4.1** Students will locate and explain safety, communication, and comfort controls used inside and outside a motor vehicle.
*   **STANDARD 4.2** Students will utilize and demonstrate an established pre-driving routine.
*   **STANDARD 4.3** Students will demonstrate the steps of safe driving maneuvers.
*   **STANDARD 4.4** Students will analyze and apply data relating to the science and physics of driving, specifically the importance of controlling speed in all driving maneuvers to increase safety.
*   **STANDARD 4.5** Students will evaluate information that describes current technology available in motor vehicles and how to use the technology to increase driver safety.

*   **STANDARD 4.6** Students will perform map reading and trip planning exercises using current and emerging technology.

## STRAND 5: THE DRIVING ENVIRONMENT

Recognizing and responding to the driving environment is essential for safe driving. Driving environment includes—but is not limited to—weather and lighting conditions, rural and urban roadways, emergency situations, sharing the road with pedestrians, trains, tractor-trailers, and other non-typical vehicles.

*   **STANDARD 5.1** Students will compare and contrast urban and rural driving conditions.
*   **STANDARD 5.2** Students will describe the responsibilities of sharing the road with bikes, pedestrians, motor vehicles, trains, tractor-trailers, and emergency vehicles.
*   **STANDARD 5.3** Students will recognize and react safely to adverse conditions.
