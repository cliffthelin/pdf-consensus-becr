The Utah Core Standards are aligned to scientifically based content standards. They drive high quality instruction through statewide comprehensive expectations for all students. The standards outline essential knowledge, concepts, and skills to be mastered at each grade level or within a critical content area.

        "content": "America is perhaps the only nation on the earth where the automobile is widely considered essential. The automobile affects nearly every aspect of our daily lives. Few things so occupy the attention and dreams of young Americans as getting a driver license. Sadly, many of these young Americans will not escape tragic results —loss of property, injury, or even the loss of life—due to insufficient driving skills or inattention to driving conditions. Since the automobile is such a substantial part of American life, it is imperative that vehicle operators possess the requisite skill and knowledge to drive safely. This fact was recognized as early as 1955 by the Utah State Legislature, when a law was enacted which specifically authorized the Utah State Board of Education to establish standards for driver education in the state’s high schools.\n\nThe rapid growth and expansion of driver education, the emergence of innovative programs, new legislation, and the passing of the Graduated Driver Licensing laws have brought about the need to provide standards for Utah’s driver education program.\n\nRepresentatives from Utah Department of Transportation Outreach Specialists, Driver License Division, Highway Safety Office, and driver education instructors met to revise the Utah driver education standards. This committee collaboratively put together the following standards, which represent essential elements of the learning that is expected.",

Studies show that children who have higher parent or guardian involvement tend to be safer drivers and have fewer crashes over their lifetimes. The Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) laws require the parent or guardian to become more involved in their teen driver's learning period. Utah's GDL law was passed in 1999 and according to the Utah Department of Health; there has been a 62% decrease in the fatalities of teens age 15-17. Educating parents or guardians on their involvement with their teen's driving safety and GDL laws is imperative to the success of the novice driver.",
