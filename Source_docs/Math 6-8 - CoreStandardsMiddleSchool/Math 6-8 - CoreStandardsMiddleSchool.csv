# Strand: RATIOS AND PROPORTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS (6.RP)

Standard,Description
6.RP.1,"Understand the concept of a ratio and use ratio language to describe a ratio relationship between two quantities.

6.NS.6,Understand a rational number as a point on the number line. Extend number line diagrams and coordinate axes familiar from previous grades to represent points on the line and in the plane with negative number coordinates.
6.NS.6a,"Recognize opposite signs of numbers as indicating locations on opposite sides of zero on the number line; recognize that the opposite of the opposite of a number is the number itself. For example, -(-3) = 3, and zero is its own opposite."

For example, for an account balance of -30 dollars, write |-30|= 30 to describe the size of the debt in dollars."
6.NS.7d,Distinguish comparisons of absolute value from statements about order. For example: Recognize that an account balance less than –30 dollars represents a debt greater than 30 dollars.
6.NS.8,Solve real-world and mathematical problems by graphing points in all four quadrants of the coordinate plane. Include use of coordinates and absolute value to find distances between points with the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate.

Standard,Description
6.EE.2,"Write, read, and evaluate expressions in which letters represent numbers."
a.,"Write expressions that record operations with numbers and with letters representing numbers. For example, express the calculation ""Subtract y from 5"" as 5 – y and express ""Jane had $105.00 in her bank account. One year later, she had x dollars more. Write an expression that shows her new balance” as $105.00 + x."
b.,"Identify parts of an expression using mathematical terms (for example, sum, term, product, factor, quotient, coefficient); view one or more parts of an expression as a single entity and a sum of two terms. For example, describe the expression 2(8 + 7) as a product of two factors; view (8 + 7) as both a single entity and a sum of two terms."
c.,"Evaluate expressions at specific values of their variables. Include expressions that arise from formulas used in real-world problems. Perform arithmetic operations, including those involving whole-number exponents, applying the Order of Operations when there are no parentheses to specify a particular order. For example, use the formulas V = s³ and A = 6s2 to find the volume and surface area of a cube with sides of length s = 1/2."
6.EE.3,"Apply the properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions. For example, apply the distributive property to the expression 3(2 + x) to produce the equivalent expression 6 + 3x; apply the distributive property to the expression 24x + 18y to produce the equivalent expression 6(4x + 3y); apply properties of operations to y + y + y to produce the equivalent expression 3y."
6.EE.4,"Identify when two expressions are equivalent. For example, the expressions y + y + y and 3y are equivalent because they name the same number, regardless of which number y represents."
6.EE.5,"Understand solving an equation or inequality as a process of answering the question: Which values from a specified set, if any, make the equation or inequality true? Use substitution to determine whether a given number in a specified set makes an equation or inequality true."
6.EE.6,"Use variables to represent numbers and write expressions when solving a real-world or mathematical problem; understand that a variable can represent an unknown number, or, depending on the purpose at hand, any number in a specified set."
6.EE.7,"Solve real-world and mathematical problems by writing and solving equations of the form x + a = b and ax = b for cases in which a, b and x are all non-negative rational numbers."
6.EE.8,Write an inequality of the form x > c or x < c to represent a constraint or condition in a real-world or mathematical problem. Recognize that inequalities of the form x > c or x < c have infinitely many solutions; represent solutions of such inequalities on number line diagrams.

UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for MATHEMATICS
Mathematics | Grade 7
"In Grade 7, instructional time should focus on four critical areas: (1) developing understanding
of and applying proportional relationships; (2) developing understanding of operations with
rational numbers and working with expressions and linear equations; (3) solving problems
involving scale drawings and informal geometric constructions, and working with two- and
three-dimensional shapes to solve problems involving area, surface area, and volume; and (4)
drawing inferences about populations based on samples."
"(1) Students extend their understanding of ratios and develop understanding of propor-
tionality to solve single- and multi-step problems. Students use their understanding of
ratios and proportionality to solve a wide variety of percent problems, including those
involving discounts, interest, taxes, tips, and percent increase or decrease. Students solve
problems about scale drawings by relating corresponding lengths between the objects or
by using the fact that relationships of lengths within an object are preserved in similar ob-
jects. Students graph proportional relationships and understand the unit rate informally
as a measure of the steepness of the related line, called the slope. They distinguish propor-
tional relationships from other relationships."
"(2) Students develop a unified understanding of number, recognizing fractions, decimals
(that have a finite or a repeating decimal representation), and percents as different repre-
sentations of rational numbers. Students extend addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division to all rational numbers, maintaining the properties of operations and the relation-
ships between addition and subtraction, and between multiplication and division. By ap-
plying these properties, and by viewing negative numbers in terms of everyday contexts
(e.g., amounts owed or temperatures below zero), students explain and interpret the rules
for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing with negative numbers. They use the
arithmetic of rational numbers as they formulate expressions and equations in one vari-
able and use these equations to solve problems."
"(3) Students continue their work with area from Grade 6, solving problems involving the
area and circumference of a circle and surface area of three-dimensional objects. In prepa-
ration for work on congruence and similarity in Grade 8, they reason about relationships
among two-dimensional figures using scale drawings and informal geometric construc-
tions, and they gain familiarity with the relationships between angles formed by intersect-
ing lines. Students work with three-dimensional figures, relating them to two-dimensional
figures by examining cross-sections. They solve real-world and mathematical problems
involving area, surface area, and volume of two- and three-dimensional objects composed
of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes and right prisms."
"(4) Students build on their previous work with single-data distributions to compare two-
data distributions and address questions about differences between populations. They
begin informal work with random sampling to generate data sets and learn about the im-
portance of representative samples for drawing inferences."

csv
Standard,Description
7.NS.1,Apply and extend previous understandings of addition and subtraction to add and subtract rational numbers; represent addition and subtraction on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram.

,"Understand that multiplication is extended from fractions to rational numbers by requiring that operations continue to satisfy the properties of operations, particularly the distributive property, leading to products such as (-1)(-1) = 1 and the rules for multiplying signed numbers. Interpret products of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts."
,"Understand that integers can be divided, provided the divisor is not zero, and that every quotient of integers (with non-zero divisor) is a rational number. If p and q are integers, then –(p/q) = (-p)/q = p/(–q). Interpret quotients of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts."

7.EE.1,"Apply properties of operations as strategies to add, subtract, factor, and expand linear expressions with rational coefficients."
csv
Standard,Description
7.EE.2,"Understand that rewriting an expression in different forms in a problem context can shed light on the problem, and how the quantities in it are related. For example, a + 0.05a = 1.05a means that “increase by 5%” is the same as ""multiply by 1.05."""
7.EE.3,"Solve multi-step real-life and mathematical problems posed with positive and negative rational numbers in any form (whole numbers, fractions, and decimals), using tools strategically. Apply properties of operations to calculate with numbers in any form, convert between forms as appropriate, and assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies. For example: If a woman making $25 an hour gets a 10% raise, she will make an additional 1/10 of her salary an hour, or $2.50, for a new salary of $27.50. If you want to place a towel bar 9 3/4 inches long in the center of a door that is 27 1/2 inches wide, you will need to place the bar about 9 inches from each edge; this estimate can be used as a check on the exact computation."

7.EE.4a,"Solve word problems leading to equations of the form px + q = r and p(x + q) = r, where p, q, and r are specific rational numbers. Solve equations of these forms fluently.

What is its width?"
7.EE.4b,"Solve word problems leading to inequalities of the form px + q > r or px + q < r, where p, q, and r are specific rational numbers.

7.G.6,"Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, volume and surface area of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilater-als, polygons, cubes, and right prisms."

# Strand: STATISTICS AND PROBABILITY (7.SP)
Standard,Description
7.SP.1,"Understand that statistics can be used to gain information about a population by examining a sample of the population, and that generalizations about a population from a sample are valid only if the sample is representative of that population. Understand that random sampling is more likely to produce representative samples and support valid inferences."
7.SP.2,"Use data from a random sample to draw inferences about a population with an unknown characteristic of interest. Generate multiple samples (or simulated samples) of the same size to gauge the variation in estimates or predictions. For example, estimate the mean word length in a book by randomly sampling words from the book; predict the winner of a school election based on randomly sampled survey data. Gauge how far off the estimate or prediction might be."
7.SP.3,"Informally assess the degree of visual overlap of two numerical data distributions with similar variabilities, estimating the difference between the centers by expressing it as a multiple of a measure of variability. For example, the mean height of players on the basketball team is 10 cm greater than the mean height of players on the soccer team, approximately twice the variability (mean absolute deviation) on either team; on a dot plot, the separation between the two distributions of heights is noticeable."
7.SP.4,"Use measures of center and measures of variability for numerical data from random samples to draw informal comparative inferences about two populations. For example, decide whether the words in a chapter of a seventh grade science book are generally longer than the words in a chapter of a fourth grade science book."
7.SP.5,"Understand that the probability of a chance event is a number between 0 and 1 that expresses the likelihood of the event occurring. Larger numbers indicate greater likelihood. A probability near 0 indicates an unlikely event, a probability around 1½ indicates an event that is neither unlikely nor likely, and a probability near 1 indicates a likely event."

Mathematics | Grade 8
"In Grade 8, instructional time should focus on three critical areas: (1) formulating and reasoning about expressions and equations, including modeling an association in bivariate data with a linear equation, and solving linear equations and systems of linear equations; (2) grasping the concept of a function and using functions to describe quantitative relationships; (3) analyzing two- and three-dimensional space and figures using distance, angle, similarity, and congruence, and understanding and applying the Pythagorean Theorem."
"(1) Students use linear equations, linear inequalities, and systems of linear equations to represent, analyze, and solve a variety of problems. Students recognize equations for proportions (y/x = m or y = mx) as special linear equations (y = mx + b), understanding that the constant of proportionality (m) is the slope, and the graphs are lines through the origin. They understand that the slope (m) of a line is a constant rate of change, so that if the input or x-coordinate changes by an amount A, the output or y-coordinate changes by the amount mxA. Students also use a linear equation to describe the association between two quantities in bivariate data (such as arm span vs. height for students in a classroom). At this grade, fitting the model and assessing its fit to the data are done informally. Interpreting the model in the context of the data requires students to express a relationship between the two quantities in question and to interpret components of the relationship (such as slope and y-intercept) in terms of the situation."
"Students strategically choose and efficiently implement procedures to solve linear equations in one variable, understanding that when they use the properties of equality and the concept of logical equivalence, they maintain the solutions of the original equation. Students solve systems of two linear equations in two variables and relate the systems to pairs of lines in the plane; these intersect, are parallel, or are the same line. Students use linear equations, linear inequalities, systems of linear equations, linear functions, and their understanding of slope of a line to analyze situations and solve problems."
"(2) Students grasp the concept of a function as a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output. They understand that functions describe situations where one quantity determines another. They can translate among representations and partial representations of functions (noting that tabular and graphical representations may be partial representations), and they describe how aspects of the function are reflected in the different representations."
"(3) Students use ideas about distance and angles; how they behave under translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations; and ideas about congruence and similarity to describe and analyze two-dimensional figures and to solve problems. Students show that the sum of the angles in a triangle is the angle formed by a straight line, and that various configurations of lines give rise to similar triangles because of the angles created when a transversal cuts parallel lines. Students understand the statement of the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse, and can explain why the Pythagorean Theorem holds, for example, by decomposing a square in two different ways. They apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find distances between points on the coordinate plane, to find lengths, and to analyze polygons. Students complete their work on volume by solving problems involving cones, cylinders, and spheres."

Standard 8.MP.7,"Look for and make use of structure. Look closely at mathematical relationships to identify the underlying structure by recognizing a simple structure within a more complicated structure. See complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as being composed of several objects. For example, see 5 – 3(x-y)² as 5 minus a positive number times a square and use that to realize that its value cannot be more than 5 for any real numbers x and y."
Standard 8.MP.8,"Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning. Notice if reasoning is repeated, and look for both generalizations and shortcuts. Evaluate the reasonableness of intermediate results by maintaining oversight of the process while attending to the details."

# Strand: NUMBER SYSTEM (8.NS)
"Know that there are numbers that are not rational, and approximate them by rational numbers (Standards 8.NS.1-3)."
Standard 8.NS.1,"Know that numbers that are not rational are called irrational. Understand informally that every number has a decimal expansion; for rational numbers, show that the decimal expansion repeats eventually, and convert a decimal expansion which repeats eventually into a rational number."
Standard 8.NS.2,"Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the size of irrational numbers, locate them approximately on a number line diagram, and estimate the value of expressions (e.g., π²). For example, by truncating the decimal expansion of √2, show that √2 is between 1 and 2, then between 1.4 and 1.5, and explain how to continue on to get better approximations."
Standard 8.NS.3,Understand how to perform operations and simplify radicals with emphasis on square roots.

# Strand: EXPRESSIONS AND EQUATIONS (8.EE)
"Work with radical and integer exponents (Standards 8.EE.1–4). Understand the connections between proportional relationships, lines, and linear relationships (Standards 8.EE.5-6). Analyze and solve linear equations and inequalities and pairs of simultaneous linear equations (Standards 8.ΕΕ.7-8)."
Standard 8.EE.1,"Know and apply the properties of integer exponents to generate equivalent numerical expressions. For example, 32 × 3-5 = 3-3 = 1/33 = 1/27."
Standard 8.EE.2,"Use square root and cube root symbols to represent solutions to equations of the form x² = p and x³ = p, where p is a positive rational number. Evaluate square roots of small perfect squares and cube roots of small perfect cubes. Know that √2 is irrational."

Standard 8.EE.4,"Perform operations with numbers expressed in scientific notation, including problems where both decimal and scientific notation are used. Use scientific notation and choose units of appropriate size for measurements of very large or very small quantities (e.g., use millimeters per year for seafloor spreading). Interpret scientific notation that has been generated by technology."
Standard 8.EE.5,"Graph proportional relationships, interpreting the unit rate as the slope of the graph. Compare two different proportional relationships represented in different ways. For example, compare a distance-time graph to a distance-time equation to determine which of two moving objects has greater speed."
Standard 8.EE.6,Use similar triangles to explain why the slope m is the same between any two distinct points on a non-vertical line in the coordinate plane; derive the equation y = mx for a line through the origin and the equation y = mx + b for a line intercepting the vertical axis at b.
Standard 8.EE.7,Solve linear equations and inequalities in one variable.
a.,"Give examples of linear equations in one variable with one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions. Show which of these possibilities is the case by successively transforming the given equation into simpler forms, until an equivalent equation of the form x = a, a = a, or a = b results (where a and b are different numbers)."
b.,"Solve single-variable linear equations and inequalities with rational number coefficients, including equations and inequalities whose solutions require expanding expressions using the distributive property and collecting like terms."
c.,Solve single-variable absolute value equations.
Standard 8.EE.8,Analyze and solve pairs of simultaneous linear equations.
a.,"Understand that solutions to a system of two linear equations in two variables correspond to points of intersection of their graphs, because points of intersection satisfy both equations simultaneously."
b.,"Solve systems of two linear equations in two variables graphically, approximating when solutions are not integers and estimate solutions by graphing the equations. Solve simple cases by inspection. For example, 3x + 2y = 5 and 3x + 2y = 6 have no solution because 3x + 2y cannot simultaneously be 5 and 6."
c.,"Solve real-world and mathematical problems leading to two linear equations in two variables graphically. For example, given coordinates for two pairs of points, determine whether the line through the first pair of points intersects the line through the second pair."

Standard 8.G.3,"Observe that orientation of the plane is preserved in rotations and translations, but not with reflections. Describe the effect of dilations, translations, rotations, and reflections on two-dimensional figures using coordinates."
Standard 8.G.4,"Understand that a two-dimensional figure is similar to another if the second can be obtained from the first by a sequence of rotations, reflections, translations, and dilations; given two similar two-dimensional figures, describe a sequence that exhibits the similarity between them."
Standard 8.G.5,"Use informal arguments to establish facts about the angle sum and exterior angle of triangles, about the angles created when parallel lines are cut by a transversal, and the angle-angle criterion for similarity of triangles. For example, arrange three copies of the same triangle so that the sum of the three angles appears to form a line, and give an argument in terms of transversals why this is so."

Standard 8.SP.2,"Know that straight lines are widely used to model relationships between two quantitative variables. For scatter plots that suggest a linear association, informally fit a straight line, and informally assess the model fit by judging the closeness of the data points to the line."
Standard 8.SP.3,"Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems in the context of bivariate measurement data, interpreting the slope and intercept. For example, in a linear model for a biology experiment, interpret a slope of 1.5 cm/hr as meaning that an additional hour of sunlight each day is associated with an additional 1.5 cm in mature plant height. (Calculating equations for a linear model is not expected in grade 8.)"
