The Utah State Board of Education, in January of 1984, established policy requiring the identification of specific core standards to be met by all K-12 students in order to graduate from Utah's secondary schools. The Utah State Board of Education regularly updates the Utah Core Standards, while parents, teachers, and local school boards continue to control the curriculum choices that reflect local values.

The Utah Core Standards are aligned to scientifically based content standards. They drive high quality instruction through statewide comprehensive expectations for all students. The standards outline essential knowledge, concepts, and skills to be mastered at each grade level or within a critical content area. The standards provide a foundation for ensuring learning within the classroom.

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for the FINE ARTS

# Introduction

## Organization of the Standards
The Utah Core standards are organized into **strands**, which represent significant areas of learning within content areas. The Fine Arts have four strands: Create, Perform/Present/Produce, Respond, and Connect. These four strands provide the framework for a comprehensive experience in each of the five art forms: Dance, Drama/Theatre, Media Arts, Music, and Visual Arts.

Within each strand are **standards**. A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficiency to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.

## Experiencing the Fine Arts
All students should have the opportunity to experience the fine arts as part of a well-rounded education. The study of drama, dance, music, media arts, and the visual arts helps students explore realities, relationships, and ideas that cannot be expressed simply in words or numbers.

Learning in the fine arts is valuable on its own, but it also engages students in learning in other subjects. Research has shown visual arts instruction to improve reading readiness. Performing and creating facilitates the acquisition of problem-solving skills and teamwork. Those skills then can be applied to other academic areas. All fine arts have academic content. Thus, the arts can help students learn essential skills in new and exciting ways.

In the global economy, creativity is essential. Creativity in students must be nurtured and allowed to have a place in the education of the whole child in order to prepare that child for the future. The study of visual arts, dance, drama, and music, as outlined in the Utah State Core Standards, provides a venue for creativity to flourish. The fine arts provide a place for students to explore new ideas, for appropriate risk-taking, for creative problem solving, for working together with others, for developing aesthetic awareness, for exploring and expressing the world, and for cultural awareness and representation, in addition to the benefits of study in the discipline of fine arts. The study of fine arts is a critical element of a well-rounded education for every student.

# INTRODUCTION

These guidelines were created to connect Art History, Social and Ballroom Dance, and Technical Theatre to the Fine Arts Core Strands and Standards. Each of these courses are expected to meet the standards with these supplemental aids.

The Social and Ballroom Dance guidelines include cultural dance forms which are part of World (folkloric) Dance. The guidelines connect the Level I standards and should be followed in the Level II and III, as well as Ballroom Dance Company.
