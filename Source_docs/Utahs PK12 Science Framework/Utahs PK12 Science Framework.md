# INTRODUCTION

☐ Utah’s PK-12 Science Framework

Utah’s PK-12 Science framework is meant to be a flexible self-assessment tool that can be used by educators and communities alike to self-assess where they are operating effectively and where there are opportunities for growth.

Resources have been linked in every indicator section in order to equip educators with the knowledge, tools, and resources necessary to meet the instructional needs of all students. It can be used in individual classrooms, across schools, and even leveraged in system-wide professional learning experiences. Further, it provides an explicit definition of what Personalized, Competency Based Learning (PCBL) looks like in Science through the lens of the PCBL Framework. The purpose of this framework is to support districts, charters, and schools in evaluating, refining, and monitoring the essential systems, structures, and science practices necessary to achieve high-quality instruction in science. This framework is meant to provide support to Utah’s educators regarding evidence-based practices in Science.

The framework is divided into three sections: indicators, lines of evidence, and resources. Indicators represent components of effective three-dimensional science instruction (see three-dimensional science instruction introduction). These indicators are sorted into two roles, Educator and Educational Leaders. Lines of evidence represent examples of how the indicators might look in application. The resources section provides support that educators and Educational Leaders can use to achieve the indicators. All of these sections are organized by the components of the PCBL framework (see PCBL Introduction). This has been done to make the framework more practical to use for educators and educational leaders while focusing on the outcome of creating an educational environment that is conducive to student success now and in the future. A rubric adapted from research on implementation

&lt;page_number&gt;1&lt;/page_number&gt;

or Levels of Use (Hall, Kirksen, and George, 2013) of educational practices is provided within the indicators section. Its purpose is to assess current implementation of an indicator and provide next steps for future growth. It provides educators and educational leaders with the opportunity to self assess and chart their growth, while also offering communities the ability to collaboratively engage in assessing how to use their time, money and resources to continually improve.

☐ Three-Dimensional Science Instruction

Three-Dimensional Science Instruction Utah’s critical components of three-dimensional science instruction include:

**Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs)**

Practices are what scientists and engineers do as they actively engage in their work.
&lt;img&gt;A scientist looking through a microscope.&lt;/img&gt;

**Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs)**

Crosscutting concepts are the ways scientists think, the organizing structures that provide a framework for assembling pieces of scientific knowledge. They reach across disciplines and demonstrate how specific ideas are united into overarching principles.
&lt;img&gt;A scientist holding a lightbulb and a test tube.&lt;/img&gt;

**Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)**

Disciplinary Core ideas are the fundamental and explanatory pieces of knowledge that scientists know and apply as they carry out their work in their discipline.
&lt;img&gt;A book with a flask on top.&lt;/img&gt;

**Phenomena (Real World Context)**

Phenomena are natural, observable events that can be explained or predicted by using knowledge of science concepts.
&lt;img&gt;A magnet with lightning bolts.&lt;/img&gt;

&lt;page_number&gt;2&lt;/page_number&gt;

---


## Page 9

Science instruction should apprentice students into the ways scientists work, think, and apply science concepts to make sense of the world around them. Therefore, the three dimensions of science learning—practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas—need to play a part in everything teachers and students do during science instruction. And they need to be woven together in a way that builds cumulatively.

Students explain phenomena by developing and applying the Disciplinary Core Ideas and Crosscutting Concepts through the use of the Science and Engineering Practices.

&lt;img&gt;A Venn diagram showing the three dimensions of science learning. The left section is labeled "What Students Do" and contains the word "PRACTICES". The top right section is labeled "What Students Know" and contains the words "CORE IDEAS". The bottom section is labeled "How Students Think" and contains the word "CROSSCUTTING". All three sections intersect at a central circle labeled "Phenomenon or Authentic Problem".&lt;/img&gt;

Science, engineering, and technology permeate nearly every facet of modern life, and they also hold the key to meeting many of humanity’s most pressing current and future challenges...Indeed, some knowledge of science and engineering is required to engage with the major public policy issues of today as well as to make informed everyday decisions, such as selecting among alternative medical treatments or determining how to invest public funds for water supply options. In addition, understanding science and the extraordinary insights it has produced can be meaningful and relevant on a personal level, opening new worlds to explore and offering lifelong opportunities for enriching people’s lives. In these contexts, learning science is important for everyone, even those who eventually choose careers in fields other than science or engineering. (NRC, 2012, pp. 1 & 7).

This quote highlights the importance for every Utah learner to have the opportunity to acquire competence in the discipline of science. In fact, for our Utah students to have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions necessary to make critical decisions related to the welfare of their current and future lives, an understanding of the discipline of science is essential. However, many Utah students do not get a sufficient opportunity to engage with science on a regular basis during their PK-12 education. Therefore, *Utah’s PK-12 Science Framework* is designed to serve as a guide for educators to initiate productive growth and change in science opportunities, achievement, and outcomes for students.

&lt;page_number&gt;3&lt;/page_number&gt;

In 2012, new research, built upon a foundation of past research, identified best practices for science education: *A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas* (NRC). This report promotes a vision for science education that was developed from the following assumptions: children are born investigators, science instruction should focus on core ideas and practices, learners’ understanding develops over time, science and engineering require both knowledge and practice, instruction should connect to students’ interests and experiences, and administration/educators should assure all students have access to effective science instruction.

The vision of science education, promoted through these assumptions and thus the conclusion of this research, is that science instruction should scaffold students to:

“actively engage in scientific and engineering practices and apply cross-cutting concepts to deepen their understanding of the core ideas in these fields. The learning experiences provided for students should engage them with fundamental questions about the world and with how scientists have investigated and found answers to those questions. Throughout grades K-12, students should have the opportunity to carry out scientific investigations and engineering design projects related to the disciplinary core ideas.” (NRC, pp. 8-9)

Thus, a framework for quality science instruction was developed that included the following main components: Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs), Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs), Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs), and authentic, real-world application of science concepts (phenomena). The expectation for science education is that all of these components are integrated within all science instruction students experience.

For more information about three-dimensional, phenomena-based science instruction, see:
* Introduction to the *Utah Science Core Standards: Utah Science with Engineering Education (SEEEd) Standards*
* Introduction to the SEEEd Core Guides
* Observation Rubric for Three-Dimensional Teaching and Learning
* A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas (NRC, 2012)

Utah’s PK–12 Science Framework synthesizes these research findings into a framework that provides opportunities for educational leaders, educators, and providers of professional learning opportunities to evaluate their knowledge, skills, dispositions, and resources for meeting the instructional needs of all students in science. This is laid out through the lens of *Utah’s Personalized, Competency Based Learning Framework* and aligned with *Utah’s High Quality Instructional Cycle*.

&lt;page_number&gt;4&lt;/page_number&gt;

# ☐ Personalized, Competency-Based Learning

Personalized, Competency Based Learning (PCBL) tailors the instructional methods, content, and pace of learning to the individual needs of each student as they acquire specific skills and master predefined learning objectives. It utilizes a student’s different strengths, weaknesses, interests, and learning styles to advance mastery of content. Simply stated, PCBL is high-quality instruction in action.

A PCBL approach empowers students to take responsibility for their learning by giving them voice, choice, and customized support to achieve success in the essential knowledge, skills, and dispositions described in [Utah’s Portrait of a Graduate](Utah's%20Portrait%20of%20a%20Graduate). PCBL shifts the focus of the classroom from teacher-directed learning to a culture of learning driven by the students. There are five essential components of PCBL: Culture of Learning, Learner Agency, Demonstrate Competency & Assessment, Customized Supports, and Social and Emotional Learning.

## Culture of Learning

Each learner is supported by communities committed to creating the culture, structure, policies and instructional practices that engage them in their journey towards college, career and life readiness. By leveraging a learner’s unique assets and interests, holding high expectations, executing teacher clarity and fostering meaningful relationships, an inclusive culture of learning allows each learner to define their pathway to success.

## Learner Agency

Each learner develops understanding, skill and responsibility for the learning design and process in pursuit of achieving the characteristic of Utah’s Portrait of a Graduate. Learner agency is achieved through a broad range of instructional strategies including goal setting, choice in learning pathways, voice in how to demonstrate competency and learner self-assessment.

## Demonstrated Competency and Assessment

Each learner progresses through their learning based upon applying their knowledge, essential skills and dispositions. Timely, effective feedback and data from a variety of formative assessment processes are used to measure learner growth, progress and advancement based on high expectations.

## Customized Supports

Each learner is provided with or selects appropriate and timely support to achieve growth or competency and to engage in personalized learning pathways. These customized supports are based on data about the learner’s demonstrated strengths, interests and needs.

&lt;page_number&gt;5&lt;/page_number&gt;

---


## Page 12

# Social and Emotional Learning

Each learner is provided with opportunities to acquire and apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary for understanding and managing their emotions; setting and achieving positive goals; feeling and showing empathy for others; establishing and maintaining positive relationships; making responsible decisions; and self-advocating. The development of these SEL strategies is critical for a student to learn to effectively work with others, overcome challenges, and achieve success in multiple settings. Social Emotional Learning is intentionally and seamlessly integrated into classroom activities to allow students to continually build these skills.

Each section of the framework: indicators, lines of evidence, and resources, is divided into the five essential components and describes three-dimensional science instruction through the lens of PCBL. Despite the fact that many of these indicators do fit into more than one component of the PCBL Framework, they are only included within one component of the Science framework.

&lt;page_number&gt;6&lt;/page_number&gt;

## Page 13

# DEFINITIONS
for Self-Assessment Scales

The self-assessment tool uses the following five-point rubric:

**RECOGNIZING:** Educators have a beginning awareness of the indicator and are not implanting yet.

**PREPARING:** Educators are acquiring knowledge about the indicator, are exploring its implications for use, and are preparing to implement the indicator into practice.

**USING:** Educators focus most effort on the short-term, day-to-day procedural use of the indicator. The educators are primarily engaged in a step-by-step process to master the tasks required to use the indicator, which may result in a superficial implementation. Emphasis is on how using the indicator impacts the educators. Use of the indicator becomes embedded into the educator's normal routines.

**REFINING:** Educators vary the use of the indicator to increase the impact on students. Variations of indicator use are based on knowledge of both short- and long-term outcomes for students.

**RENEWING:** Educators reevaluate the quality of use of the indicator, seek major modifications or alternatives to the present use to achieve increased impact on students, examine new developments in the field, and explore new goals for themselves and the educational system. Ultimately, a new balance is achieved in which the educators combine individual use of the indicators with the related activities of colleagues to achieve a collective effect on students.

&lt;page_number&gt;7&lt;/page_number&gt;

# ELEMENT 5:
# SOCIAL & EMOTIONAL LEARNING

Each learner is provided with opportunities to acquire and apply the knowledge, attitudes and skills necessary for understanding and managing their emotions; setting and achieving positive goals; feeling and showing empathy for others; establishing and maintaining positive relationships; making responsible decisions; and self-advocating. The development of these characteristics is critical for a student to learn to effectively work with others, overcome challenges and achieve success in multiple settings. Social Emotional Learning is intentionally and seamlessly integrated into classroom activities to allow students to continually build these skills.

# LINES OF EVIDENCE

Lines of Evidence represent examples of how the indicators might look in application.

Effective assessment processes use evidence of practice to justify scores on a rubric. Below, sample evidence has been provided, aligned to the indicators of the framework, to assist in using it to identify areas of celebration and opportunities for growth. When students are stated, they could be either a K-12 student in the classroom or a teacher engaging in professional learning. When teachers are stated, they could be either a classroom teacher or an educational leader providing professional learning.

| DESCRIPTION AND LINK | |
|---|---|
| **STEM Teaching Tool #66:** Why You Should Stop Pre-Teaching Science Vocabulary and Focus on Students Developing Conceptual Meaning First | Discusses why many science educators focus on pre-teaching technical vocabulary at the start of the unit to help students become comfortable with science discourse. This approach is especially common with students from historically marginalized communities, in particular emerging multilingual students. However, it is much more productive to support learners as they organically develop language (terms, phrases) that interprets and explains phenomena, rather than asking them to merely acquire terms. Additionally, it is key for equity that educators identify, value, and leverage students’ home languages. [https://stemteachingtools.org/brief/66](https://stemteachingtools.org/brief/66) |
| **STEM Teaching Tool #85:** Principals! Here’s What You Can Do to Foster Equitable Three-Dimensional Science Learning | Discusses how principals directly influence classroom instruction, second only to teachers in impact on student achievement. However, school principals have varied content and pedagogical backgrounds and few have had learning experiences engaging in the practices of scientists and engineers to explain phenomena and solve challenging problems. Without these experiences, too few principals are effectively leading for improvement of equitable science instruction. This tool describes some steps that districts and/or individual principals can take to enable them to effectively lead the implementation of three-dimensional (3D) science learning in their schools. [https://stemteachingtools.org/brief/85](https://stemteachingtools.org/brief/85) |
| **STEM Teaching Tool #91:** Why and How Should I Use Crosscutting Concepts to Enhance My Science Instruction? | Provides clarity on the instructional use of the CCCs to promote integrated understanding and sensemaking. [https://stemteachingtools.org/brief/91](https://stemteachingtools.org/brief/91) |
