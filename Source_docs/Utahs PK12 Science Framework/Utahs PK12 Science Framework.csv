Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs),Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs)
Practices are what scientists and engineers do as they actively engage in their work.,"Crosscutting concepts are the ways scientists think, the organizing structures that provide a framework for assembling pieces of scientific knowledge. They reach across disciplines and demonstrate how specific ideas are united into overarching principles."

Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs),Phenomena (Real World Context
Disciplinary Core ideas are the fundamental and explanatory pieces of knowledge that scientists know and apply as they carry out their work in their discipline.,"Phenomena are natural, observable events that can be explained or predicted by using knowledge of science concepts."

Social and Emotional Learning
Each learner is provided with opportunities to acquire and apply the knowledge,
attitudes, and skills necessary for understanding and managing their emotions;
setting and achieving positive goals; feeling and showing empathy for others;
establishing and maintaining positive relationships; making responsible deci-
sions; and self-advocating. The development of these SEL strategies is critical
for a student to learn to effectively work with others, overcome challenges, and
achieve success in multiple settings. Social Emotional Learning is intentionally
and seamlessly integrated into classroom activities to allow students to continu-
ally build these skills.
Each section of the framework: indicators, lines of evidence, and resources, is di-
vided into the five essential components and describes three-dimensional science
instruction through the lens of PCBL. Despite the fact that many of these indicators
do fit into more than one component of the PCBL Framework, they are only includ-
ed within one component of the Science framework.
csv
Category,Description
RECOGNIZING,Educators have a beginning awareness of the indicator and are not implanting yet.
PREPARING,"Educators are acquiring knowledge about the indicator, are exploring its implications for use, and are preparing to implement the indicator into practice."
USING,"Educators focus most effort on the short-term, day-to-day procedural use of the indicator. The educators are primarily engaged in a step-by-step process to master the tasks required to use the indicator, which may result in a superficial implementation. Emphasis is on how using the indicator impacts the educators. Use of the indicator becomes embedded into the educator's normal routines."
REFINING,Educators vary the use of the indicator to increase the impact on students. Variations of indicator use are based on knowledge of both short- and long-term outcomes for students.
RENEWING,"Educators reevaluate the quality of use of the indicator, seek major modifications or alternatives to the present use to achieve increased impact on students, examine new developments in the field, and explore new goals for themselves and the educational system. Ultimately, a new balance is achieved in which the educators combine individual use of the indicators with the related activities of colleagues to achieve a collective effect on students."

ence discourse. This approach is especially common
with students from historically marginalized commu-

However, it is much more productive to support
learners as they organically develop language (terms,
phrases) that interprets and explains phenomena,
rather than asking them to merely acquire terms. Ad-
ditionally, it is key for equity that educators identify,
value, and leverage students' home languages.
