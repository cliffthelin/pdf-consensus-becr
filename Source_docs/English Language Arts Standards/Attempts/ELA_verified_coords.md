INTRODUCTION
The P–12 Utah State Standards for English Language Arts (ELA) were revised by 
Utah educators in 2022 to identify the key literacy standards necessary for Utah 
students to master by the end of each grade level. Some standards are mastered in 
previous grades. If a student has not mastered previous grade-level standards, the 
teacher will need to intervene in order to fill the student's skill gaps.
Organization 
The Utah State Standards are organized into strands, which represent signifi-
cant areas of learning within content areas. In ELA, these strands are speaking 
and listening, reading, and writing.
Within each strand are standards. All standards are considered essential to 
master. The skills in the standards require repeated exposure with increasingly 
complex texts and in increasingly sophisticated contexts. Mastery is only ob-
tained by regular practice over time. 
Shifts in the Standards
Changes in the standards were made to improve the consistency and practicality 
of the standards. These changes include:
 ] The standards were reduced, simplified, and clarified.
 ] Phonological Awareness was added in grades 2 and 3.
 ] The Reading Literature (RL) and Reading Informational (RI) standards were 
combined where it was most logical.
 ] The language strand of standards was woven throughout the speaking 
and listening, reading, and writing strands.
 ] Much like 9–10 and 11–12, 7th and 8th grade standards were banded. 
 ] References to specific texts were removed from the standards in an ef-
fort to broaden representation and enhance local control over curricular 
choices.
Speaking and Listening Strand
The following standards offer a focus for speaking and listening instruction each 
year to help ensure that students gain adequate mastery of a range of skills and 
applications. Students develop useful interpersonal skills for the classroom and 
workplace by having the opportunity to listen to each other, respond appro-
priately, and evaluate what they hear from a variety of sources. The standards 
stress preparing for and participating effectively in a range of conversations and 
collaborations. Students advancing through the grades are expected to meet 
each year’s grade-specific standards and retain or further develop skills and un-

derstandings mastered in preceding grades, including but not limited to, com-
munication and interpersonal skills. Young students may master acquisition of 
certain speech sounds at different ages. The chart below includes the typical age 
of acquisition of each sound.

Reading Strand
The following reading standards offer a focus for reading instruction while build-
ing core knowledge and deepening comprehension. Students advancing through 
the grades are expected to meet each year’s grade-specific standards and retain 
or further develop skills and understandings mastered in preceding grades by 
reading increasingly complex texts throughout the grades. Texts should reflect a 
variety of genres, time periods, topics, perspectives, cultures, and backgrounds. 
Reading standards include reading literature and reading informational texts. 
Reading Literature is indicated with (RL) and Reading Informational with (RI). 
The Reading Strand includes the foundational skills in the primary grades. These 
foundational skills are not an end in and of themselves. Rather, they are neces-
sary and important components of effective, evidence-based reading instruction 
to develop reading proficiency with the capacity to comprehend texts across a 
range of types and disciplines. Some readers will need more or less practice with 
these foundational skills than other readers. The point is to teach students what 
they need to learn in order to be successful, proficient readers. 
An important part of comprehensive reading instruction is that students acquire 
knowledge of language, particularly in using accurate academic and domain-spe-
cific words and phrases, sufficient for reading, writing, speaking, and listening. 
Thus, the reading standards weave in language standards focused on vocabulary 
P
-
H
U
R
T
<<endpage>>

<<page: 12 | I>>
and language comprehension. These skills will help students develop indepen-
dence as readers and writers when considering a word or phrase important to 
comprehension.   
Students must also be immersed in reading challenging, complex texts to ac-
tively make meaning, answer questions, solve problems, and craft arguments. 
Text complexity includes qualitative features of text and a range of texts within 
the quantitative grade band and associated Lexile ranges. Standard R.4 includes 
an asterisk to refer educators back to the Text Complexity Grade Bands and 
Associated Lexile Ranges below.

Engaging students in deep discussions and writing of texts is imperative to their 
growth and development as readers. Writing and discussion of text focuses on 
key ideas and details, craft and structure, and integrating knowledge and ideas. 
Students then need to return to previously-read texts to compare with other 
texts and synthesize the information from multiple texts for presentations, proj-
ects, or additional writing.  
Writing Strand
The following standards offer a focus for writing instruction to ensure that stu-
dents gain adequate mastery of a range of writing skills and applications to ad-
dress increasingly demanding content and sources. Students advancing through 
the grades are expected to meet each year’s grade-specific standards and re-
tain or further develop skills and understandings mastered in preceding grades. 
Students’ production of writing should focus more on content and ideas rather 
than on length. Therefore, length requirements per grade are not included in 
the standards. 
Students will learn to research, plan, draft, revise, edit, and publish. These 
skills are applicable to many types of writing such as opinion, argumentative, 
informative, explanatory, and narrative. The standards stress the importance 
of the reading-writing connection by requiring students to draw upon and
