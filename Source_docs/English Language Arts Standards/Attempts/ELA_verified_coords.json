      "text": "INTRODUCTION\nThe P–12 Utah State Standards for English Language Arts (ELA) were revised by \nUtah educators in 2022 to identify the key literacy standards necessary for Utah \nstudents to master by the end of each grade level. Some standards are mastered in \nprevious grades. If a student has not mastered previous grade-level standards, the \nteacher will need to intervene in order to fill the student's skill gaps.\nOrganization \nThe Utah State Standards are organized into strands, which represent signifi-\ncant areas of learning within content areas. In ELA, these strands are speaking \nand listening, reading, and writing.\nWithin each strand are standards. All standards are considered essential to \nmaster. The skills in the standards require repeated exposure with increasingly \ncomplex texts and in increasingly sophisticated contexts. Mastery is only ob-\ntained by regular practice over time. \nShifts in the Standards\nChanges in the standards were made to improve the consistency and practicality \nof the standards. These changes include:\n ] The standards were reduced, simplified, and clarified.\n ] Phonological Awareness was added in grades 2 and 3.\n ] The Reading Literature (RL) and Reading Informational (RI) standards were \ncombined where it was most logical.\n ] The language strand of standards was woven throughout the speaking \nand listening, reading, and writing strands.\n ] Much like 9–10 and 11–12, 7th and 8th grade standards were banded. \n ] References to specific texts were removed from the standards in an ef-\nfort to broaden representation and enhance local control over curricular \nchoices.\nSpeaking and Listening Strand\nThe following standards offer a focus for speaking and listening instruction each \nyear to help ensure that students gain adequate mastery of a range of skills and \napplications. Students develop useful interpersonal skills for the classroom and \nworkplace by having the opportunity to listen to each other, respond appro-\npriately, and evaluate what they hear from a variety of sources. The standards \nstress preparing for and participating effectively in a range of conversations and \ncollaborations. Students advancing through the grades are expected to meet \neach year’s grade-specific standards and retain or further develop skills and un-\nP\n-\nH\nU\nR\nT"

(1990)\nReading Strand\nThe following reading standards offer a focus for reading instruction while build-\ning core knowledge and deepening comprehension. Students advancing through \nthe grades are expected to meet each year’s grade-specific standards and retain \nor further develop skills and understandings mastered in preceding grades by \nreading increasingly complex texts throughout the grades. Texts should reflect a \nvariety of genres, time periods, topics, perspectives, cultures, and backgrounds. \nReading standards include reading literature and reading informational texts. \nReading Literature is indicated with (RL) and Reading Informational with (RI). \nThe Reading Strand includes the foundational skills in the primary grades. These \nfoundational skills are not an end in and of themselves. Rather, they are neces-\nsary and important components of effective, evidence-based reading instruction \nto develop reading proficiency with the capacity to comprehend texts across a \nrange of types and disciplines. Some readers will need more or less practice with \nthese foundational skills than other readers. The point is to teach students what \nthey need to learn in order to be successful, proficient readers. \nAn important part of comprehensive reading instruction is that students acquire \nknowledge of language, particularly in using accurate academic and domain-spe-\ncific words and phrases, sufficient for reading, writing, speaking, and listening. \nThus, the reading standards weave in language standards focused on vocabulary \nP\n-\nH\nU\nR\nT"

These skills will help students develop indepen-\ndence as readers and writers when considering a word or phrase important to \ncomprehension.   \nStudents must also be immersed in reading challenging, complex texts to ac-\ntively make meaning, answer questions, solve problems, and craft arguments. \nText complexity includes qualitative features of text and a range of texts within \nthe quantitative grade band and associated Lexile ranges.

Therefore, length requirements per grade are not included in \nthe standards. \nStudents will learn to research, plan, draft, revise, edit, and publish.
