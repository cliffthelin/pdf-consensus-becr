Reading Literature is indicated with (RL) and Reading Informational with (RI).\n\nThe Reading Strand includes the foundational skills in the primary grades. These foundational skills are not an end in and of themselves. Rather, they are necessary and important components of effective, evidence-based reading instruction to develop reading proficiency with the capacity to comprehend texts across a range of types and disciplines. Some readers will need more or less practice with these foundational skills than other readers. The point is to teach students what they need to learn in order to be successful, proficient readers.\n\nAn important part of comprehensive reading instruction is that students acquire knowledge of language, particularly in using accurate academic and domain-specific words and phrases, sufficient for reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Thus, the reading standards weave in language standards focused on vocabulary",
