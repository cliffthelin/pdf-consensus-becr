The Utah State Board of Education, in January of 1984, established policy requiring the identification of specific core standards to be met by all K-12 students in order to graduate from Utah's secondary schools. The Utah State Board of Education regularly updates the Utah Core Standards, while parents, teachers, and local school boards continue to control the curriculum choices that reflect local values.

The Utah Core Standards are aligned to scientifically based content standards. They drive high quality instruction through statewide comprehensive expectations for all students. The standards outline essential knowledge, concepts, and skills to be mastered at each grade level or within a critical content area. The standards provide a foundation for ensuring learning within the classroom.

# INTRODUCTION

## ORGANIZATION OF THE STANDARDS
The Utah Core Standards are organized into **strands**, which represent significant areas of learning within content areas. Depending on the core area, these strands may be designated by time periods, thematic principles, modes of practice, or other organizing principles.

Within each strand are **standards**. A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficiency to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.

## THE GOAL OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION
is to develop healthy, responsible students who have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to work together in groups, think critically, and participate in a variety of activities that lead to a lifelong healthy lifestyle. Research tells us that students who are physically active for 60 minutes a day have higher self-confidence and more active synapses in the brain, experience a decrease in chronic illnesses, and are less likely to be absent from school. Such students are ready for career and college success. Time given to physical activity in school must not only be incorporated, but be of the highest quality. The Physical Education Core utilizes appropriate instructional practices to develop competence and confidence in a variety of lifetime activities and movement forms, including sports, dance, outdoor recreation, and physical fitness. The emphasis is on providing success and enjoyment for all students. Knowledge of the relationship between proper nutrition and a consistent fitness regimen is the common thread running through the core. Students develop life skills through cooperative and competitive activity participation, and learn the value of a physically active life.

# INTRODUCTION

The Physical Education Core for secondary students is a culmination of years spent developing interest and skill in a variety of physical activities. The goal of physical education is to develop healthy, responsible students who have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to work together in groups, think critically, and participate in a variety of activities that lead to a lifelong healthy lifestyle. Research tells us that students who are physically active for 60 minutes a day have higher self-confidence and more active synapses in the brain, experience a decrease in chronic illnesses, and are less likely to be absent from school. Such students are ready for career and college success. Time given to physical activity in school must not only be incorporated, but of the highest quality. The Physical Education Core utilizes appropriate instructional practices to develop competence and confidence in a variety of lifetime activity and movement forms, including sports, dance, outdoor recreation, and physical fitness activities. The emphasis is on providing success and enjoyment for all students. Knowledge of the relationship between proper nutrition and a consistent fitness regimen is the common thread running through the core. Students develop life skills through cooperative and competitive activity participation, and learn the value of a physically active life.

# DANCE
## Supplemental Standards

### INTRODUCTION
The goal of physical education is to develop healthy, responsible students who have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to work together in groups, think critically, and participate in a variety of activities that lead to a lifelong healthy lifestyle. For graduation, students must complete courses in each of the following physical education courses: Participation Skills and Techniques, Fitness for Life, and Individual Lifetime Activities. Dance courses may be used to fulfill the graduation requirement for Individual Lifetime Activities when the course meets the Core Standards. These supplemental standards outline how a dance course fulfills the graduation requirement using the strands from the Utah Core Standards for Physical Education.

**Strand 1: Students will achieve a level of competency in motor skills and movement patterns.**

*   **Dance.1.1:** Demonstrate proprioceptive awareness and overall body coordination during locomotor and axial movement. Demonstrate appropriate anatomical alignment and balance, as well as body actions like isolation and segmentation.
*   **Dance.1.2:** Utilize spatial elements by designing and sculpting still body-shapes, and exploring levels and floor/air pathways, all while maintaining a sense of spatial design in relation to other dancers, objects, and environment.
*   **Dance.1.3:** Demonstrate time elements by analyzing and performing metric and non-metric rhythms, and a variety of tempi.
*   **Dance.1.4:** Demonstrate energy qualities and contrasting dynamics in dance performance.

**Strand 2: Students will apply knowledge to attain efficient movement and performance.**

*   **Dance.2.1:** Use the elements (e.g., body, space, time, energy) of dance to create a movement study based on a central idea or intent. Apply knowledge of the elements of dance to improve performance and movement exercises.
*   **Dance 2.2:** Apply body-mind and anatomical principles to a range of technical dance skills for achieving fluency of movement.

# OUTDOOR RECREATION
## Supplemental Standards

### INTRODUCTION
The goal of physical education is to develop healthy, responsible students who have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to work together in groups, think critically, and participate in a variety of activities that lead to a lifelong healthy lifestyle. For graduation, students must complete courses in each of the following physical education courses: Participation Skills and Techniques, Fitness for Life, and Individual Lifetime Activities. Recreation courses may be used to fulfill the graduation requirement for Individual Lifetime Activities when the course meets the Core Standards. These **supplemental standards** outline how a recreation course fulfills the graduation requirement using the strands from the Utah Core Standards for Physical Education.

Outdoor recreation or outdoor activity refers to recreation engaged in out of doors, most commonly in natural settings. Outdoor recreation includes activities that are designed for all levels of ability and should be facilitated to provide accommodations and adaptations as necessary. When the activity involves exceptional excitement, physical challenge, or risk, it is sometimes referred to as “adventure recreation” or “adventure training”, rather than an extreme sport. By participating in these activities, students learn not only lifelong leisure activities, but also about safety, risk, decision making, problem solving, leadership, and communication skills while participating in physically demanding activities.

Strand 1: Students will achieve a level of competency in motor skills and movement patterns.

*   Rec.1.1: Recognize the importance of and perform correct body positioning as it applies to activity (e.g., athletic stance, skiing, standup paddle boarding, biking, canoeing).
