        "content": "The Utah State Board of Education, in January of 1984, established policy requiring the identification of specific core standards to be met by all K-12 students in order to graduate from Utah's secondary schools. The Utah State Board of Education regularly updates the Utah Core Standards, while parents, teachers, and local school boards continue to control the curriculum choices that reflect local values.\n\nThe Utah Core Standards are aligned to scientifically based content standards. They drive high quality instruction through statewide comprehensive expectations for all students. The standards outline essential knowledge, concepts, and skills to be mastered at each grade level or within a critical content area. The standards provide a foundation for ensuring learning within the classroom.",

Research tells us that students who are physically active for 60 minutes a day have higher self-confidence and more active synapses in the brain, experience a decrease in chronic illnesses, and are less likely to be absent from school. Such students are ready for career and college success. Time given to physical activity in school must not only be incorporated, but be of the highest quality. The Physical Education Core utilizes appropriate instructional practices to develop competence and confidence in a variety of lifetime activities and movement forms, including sports, dance, outdoor recreation, and physical fitness. The emphasis is on providing success and enjoyment for all students. Knowledge of the relationship between proper nutrition and a consistent fitness regimen is the common thread running through the core. Students develop life skills through cooperative and competitive activity participation, and learn the value of a physically active life.",

The goal of physical education is to develop healthy, responsible students who have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to work together in groups, think critically, and participate in a variety of activities that lead to a lifelong healthy lifestyle. Research tells us that students who are physically active for 60 minutes a day have higher self-confidence and more active synapses in the brain, experience a decrease in chronic illnesses, and are less likely to be absent from school. Such students are ready for career and college success. Time given to physical activity in school must not only be incorporated, but of the highest quality. The Physical Education Core utilizes appropriate instructional practices to develop competence and confidence in a variety of lifetime activity and movement forms, including sports, dance, outdoor recreation, and physical fitness activities. The emphasis is on providing success and enjoyment for all students. Knowledge of the relationship between proper nutrition and a consistent fitness regimen is the common thread running through the core. Students develop life skills through cooperative and competitive activity participation, and learn the value of a physically active life.",
