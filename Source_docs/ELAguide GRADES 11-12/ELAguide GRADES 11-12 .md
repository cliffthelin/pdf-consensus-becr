**ACADEMIC LANGUAGE**
Discourse, dialogue, active listening, evidence, support, summarize, interpret, and explain

**ASSESSMENT EXEMPLARS**

*   SEED Discussions—Rubrics for Active Speaking and Listening
*   Reciprocal Teaching or Literature Circles—Roles for Collaborative Conversations—Predict, Question, Clarify, Summarize
*   Students can engage in brief question and answer sessions following presentations given by peers. Students respond thoughtfully to audience questions and comments, clarifying, verifying, or challenging ideas as appropriate.
*   Example performance assessment: Instruct students to prepare two-to-three minute responses to at least four of the questions; this will be done in a Fishbowl discussion. Explain to students these presentations cannot be a written assignment that is read aloud but should use a narrative or explanatory format to convey the most compelling and relevant aspects of their responses.
    *   **Interview Questions:** What three adjectives best describe you? What are your strengths and weaknesses? What activities do you find most rewarding? What is your favorite book? What do you want to do after graduating from college? What do you expect to be doing ten years from now? Why do you want to attend our college? What can you contribute to our college campus?
*   Save the Last Word
    1.  Identify a reading or video excerpt that will serve as the catalyst for this activity.
    2.  Have students read or view the selected text. Ask students to highlight three sentences that particularly stood out for them and write each sentence on the front of an index card. On the back, they should write a few sentences explaining why they chose that quote—what it meant to them, reminded them of, etc. They may have connected it to something that happened to them in their own life, to a film or book they saw or read, or to something that happened in history or is happening in current events.
    3.  Divide the students into groups of three, labeling one student A, one B, and the other C in each group. Invite the A students to read one of their chosen quotations to their group. Then students B and C discuss the quotation. What do they think it means? Why do they think these words might be important? To whom? After several minutes, ask the A students to read the back of their card (or to explain why they picked the quotation), thus having “the last word.” This process continues with the B students sharing and then the C students.

# GRAMMAR AND CONVENTIONS PROGRESSION CHART

The following table provides a suggested list of grammar and conventions for teachers to use when implementing the P-12 Utah English Language Arts Standards, specifically writing standards one through three and speaking and listening standard three. Teaching grammar and conventions is a component of overall language instruction. Therefore, this instruction needs to be embedded within contexts where students are authentically producing and consuming language (i.e., reading, writing, and speaking and listening) rather than taught as isolated skills.
