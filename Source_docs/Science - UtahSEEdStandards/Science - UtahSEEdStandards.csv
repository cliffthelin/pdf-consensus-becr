"Organisms (plants and animals, including humans) have unique and diverse life cycles, but
they all follow a pattern of birth, growth, reproduction, and death. Different organisms vary in
how they look and function because they have different inherited traits. An organism's traits
are inherited from its parents and can be influenced by the environment. Variations in traits
between individuals in a population may provide advantages in surviving and reproducing in

low them to survive, some move to new locations, and some do not survive. Humans can de-
sign solutions to reduce the impact of environmental changes on organisms.",

Heredity,"is a unifying biological principle that explains how information is passed from parent to offspring through deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules in the form of chromosomes. Distinct sequences of DNA, called genes, carry the code for specific proteins, which are responsible for the specific traits and life functions of organisms. There are predictable patterns of inheritance; however, changes in the DNA sequence and environmental factors may alter genetic expression.

"UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEED) STANDARDS
and accuracy. Scientific habits of mind include questioning, communicating,
reasoning, analyzing, collaborating, and thinking critically. These values are shared
within and across scientific disciplines, and should be embraced by students, teachers,
and society at large.
Science is principled and enduring.
Scientific knowledge is constructed from empirical evidence; therefore, it is both
changeable and durable. Science is based on observations and inferences, an
understanding of scientific laws and theories, use of scientific methods, creativity, and
collaboration. The Utah SEEd standards are based on current scientific theories, which
are powerful and broad explanations of a wide range of phenomena; they are not
simply guesses nor are they unchangeable facts.
Science is principled in that it is limited to observable evidence. Science is also
enduring in that theories are only accepted when they are robustly supported by
multiple lines of peer reviewed evidence. The history of science demonstrates how
scientific knowledge can change and progress, and it is rooted in the cultures from
which it emerged. Scientists, engineers, and society, are responsible for developing
scientific understandings with integrity, supporting claims with existing and new
evidence, interpreting competing explanations of phenomena, changing models
purposefully, and finding applications that are ethical.
Principles of Science Learning
Just as science is an active endeavor, students best learn science by engaging in it. This
includes gathering information through observations, reasoning, and communicating with
others. It is not enough for students to read about or watch science from a distance; learners
must become active participants in forming their ideas and engaging in scientific practice.
The Utah SEEd standards are based on several core philosophical and research-based
underpinnings of science learning.
Science learning is personal and engaging.
Research in science education supports the assertion that students at all levels learn
most when they are able to construct and reflect upon their ideas, both by themselves
and in collaboration with others. Learning is not merely an act of retaining information
but creating ideas informed by evidence and linked to previous ideas and experiences.
Therefore, the most productive learning settings engage students in authentic
experiences with natural phenomena or problems to be solved. Learners develop tools
for understanding as they look for patterns, develop explanations, and communicate
with others. Science education is most effective when learners invest in their own
sense-making and their learning context provides an opportunity to engage with real-
world problems.
Science learning is multi-purposed.
Science learning serves many purposes. We learn science because it brings us joy and
appreciation but also because it solves problems, expands understanding, and informs"
