# Utah Science with Engineering Education Standards

Utah’s Science and Engineering Education (SEEd) standards were written by Utah educators and scientists, using a wide array of resources and expertise. A great deal is known about good science instruction. The writing team used sources including *A Framework for K–12 Science Education*¹, the *Next Generation Science Standards*², and related works to craft research-based standards for Utah. These standards were written with students in mind, including developmentally appropriate progressions that foster learning that is simultaneously age-appropriate and enduring. The aim was to address what an educated citizenry should know and understand to embrace the value of scientific thinking and make informed decisions. The SEEd standards are founded on what science is, how science is learned, and the multiple dimensions of scientific work.

## Principles of Scientific Literacy

Science is a way of knowing, a process for understanding the natural world. Engineering applies the fields of science, technology, and mathematics to produce solutions to real-world problems. The process of developing scientific knowledge includes ongoing questioning, testing, and refinement of ideas when supported by empirical evidence. Since progress in modern society is tied so closely to this way of knowing, scientific literacy is essential for a society to be engaged in political and economic choices on personal, local, regional, and global scales. As such, the Utah SEEd standards are based on the following essential elements of scientific literacy.

**Science is valuable, relevant, and applicable.**
Science produces knowledge that is inherently important to our society and culture. Science and engineering support innovation and enhance the lives of individuals and society. Science is supported from and benefited by an equitable and democratic culture. Science is for all people, at all levels of education, and from all backgrounds.

**Science is a shared way of knowing and doing.**
Science learning experiences should celebrate curiosity, wonder, skepticism, precision, and accuracy. Scientific habits of mind include questioning, communicating, reasoning, analyzing, collaborating, and thinking critically. These values are shared within and across scientific disciplines, and should be embraced by students, teachers, and society at large.

**Science is principled and enduring.**
Scientific knowledge is constructed from empirical evidence; therefore, it is both changeable and durable. Science is based on observations and inferences, an understanding of scientific laws and theories, use of scientific methods, creativity, and collaboration. The Utah SEEd standards are based on current scientific theories, which are powerful and broad explanations of a wide range of phenomena; they are not simply guesses nor are they unchangeable facts. Science is principled in that it is limited to observable evidence. Science is also enduring in that theories are only accepted when they are robustly supported by multiple lines of peer reviewed evidence. The history of science demonstrates

how scientific knowledge can change and progress, and it is rooted in the cultures from which it emerged. Scientists, engineers, and society, are responsible for developing scientific understandings with integrity, supporting claims with existing and new evidence, interpreting competing explanations of phenomena, changing models purposefully, and finding applications that are ethical.

## Principles of Science Learning

Just as science is an active endeavor, students best learn science by engaging in it. This includes gathering information through observations, reasoning, and communicating with others. It is not enough for students to read about or watch science from a distance; learners must become active participants in forming their ideas and engaging in scientific practice. The Utah SEEd standards are based on several core philosophical and research-based underpinnings of science learning.

### Science learning is personal and engaging.

Research in science education supports the assertion that students at all levels learn most when they are able to construct and reflect upon their ideas, both by themselves and in collaboration with others. Learning is not merely an act of retaining information but creating ideas informed by evidence and linked to previous ideas and experiences. Therefore, the most productive learning settings engage students in authentic experiences with natural phenomena or problems to be solved. Learners develop tools for understanding as they look for patterns, develop explanations, and communicate with others. Science education is most effective when learners invests in their own sense-making and their learning context provides an opportunity to engage with real-world problems.

### Science learning is multi-purposed.

Science learning serves many purposes. We learn science because it brings us joy and appreciation but also because it solves problems, expands understanding, and informs society. It allows us to make predictions, improve our world, and mitigate challenges. An understanding of science and how it works is necessary in order to participate in a democratic society. So, not only is science a tool to be used by the future engineer or lab scientist but also by every citizen, every artist, and every other human who shares an appreciation for the world in which we live.

### All students are capable of science learning.

Science learning is a right of all individuals and must be accessible to all students in equitable ways. Independent of grade level, geography, gender, economic status, cultural background, or any other demographic descriptor, all K–12 students are capable of science learning and science literacy. Science learning is most equitable when students have agency and can engage in practices of science and sense-making for themselves, under the guidance and mentoring of an effective teacher and within an environment that puts student experience at the center of instruction. Moreover, all students are capable learners of science, and all grades and classes should provide authentic, developmentally appropriate science instruction.

## Three Dimensions of Science

Science is composed of multiple types of knowledge and tools. These include the processes of doing science, the structures that help us organize and connect our understandings, and the deep explanatory pieces of knowledge that provide predictive power. These facets of science are represented as “three dimensions” of science learning, and together these help us to make sense of all that science does and represents. These include science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas. Taken together, these represent how we use science to make sense of phenomena, and they are most meaningful when learned in concert with one another. These are described in *A Framework for K–12 Science Education*, referenced above, and briefly described here:

**Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs):** Practices refer to the things that scientists and engineers do and how they actively engage in their work. Scientists do much more than make hypotheses and test them with experiments. They engage in wonder, design, modeling, construction, communication, and collaboration. The practices describe the variety of activities that are necessary to do science, and they also imply how scientific thinking is related to thinking in other subjects, including math, writing, and the arts. For a further understanding of science and engineering practices see Chapter 3 in *A Framework for K–12 Science Education*.

**Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs):** Crosscutting concepts are the organizing structures that provide a framework for assembling pieces of scientific knowledge. They reach across disciplines and demonstrate how specific ideas are united into overarching principles. For example, a mechanical engineer might design some process that transfers energy from a fuel source into a moving part, while a biologist might study how predators and prey are interrelated. Both of these would need to model systems of energy to understand how all of the features interact, even though they are studying different subjects. Understanding crosscutting concepts enables us to make connections among different subjects and to utilize science in diverse settings. Additional information on crosscutting concepts can be found in Chapter 4 of *A Framework for K–12 Science Education*.

**Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs):** Core ideas within the SEEd Standards include those most fundamental and explanatory pieces of knowledge in a discipline. They are often what we traditionally associate with science knowledge and specific subject areas within science. These core ideas are organized within physical, life, and earth sciences, but within each area further specific organization is appropriate. All these core ideas are described in chapters 5 through 8 in the *K–12 Framework* text, and these are employed by the Utah SEEd standards to help clarify the focus of each strand in a grade level or content area.

Even though the science content covered by SEPs, CCCs, and DCIs is substantial, the Utah SEEd standards are not meant to address every scientific concept. Instead, these standards were written to address and engage in an appropriate depth of knowledge, including perspectives into how that knowledge is obtained and where it fits in broader contexts, for students to continue to use and expand their understandings over a lifetime.

# UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS

## Organization of Standards

The Utah SEEd standards are organized into **strands** which represent significant areas of learning within grade level progressions and content areas. Each strand introduction is an orientation for the teacher in order to provide an overall view of the concepts needed for foundational understanding. These include descriptions of how the standards tie together thematically and which DCIs are used to unite that theme. Within each strand are **standards**. A standard is an articulation of how a learner may demonstrate their proficiency, incorporating not only the disciplinary core idea but also a crosscutting concept and a science and engineering practice. While a standard represents an essential element of what is expected, it does not dictate curriculum—it only represents a proficiency level for that grade. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for a comprehensive understanding of a strand’s purpose.

The standards of any given grade or course are not independent. SEEd standards are written with developmental levels and learning progressions in mind so that many topics are built upon from one grade to another. In addition, SEPs and CCCs are especially well paralleled with other disciplines, including English language arts, fine arts, mathematics, and social sciences. Therefore, SEEd standards should be considered to exist not as an island unto themselves, but as a part of an integrated, comprehensive, and holistic educational experience.

Each standard is framed upon the three dimensions of science to represent a cohesive, multi-faceted science learning outcome.

*   Within each SEEd Standard **Science and Engineering Practices** are bolded.
*   Crosscutting Concepts are underlined.
*   Disciplinary Core Ideas are added to the standard in normal font with the relevant DCIs codes from the *K–12 Framework* (indicated in parentheses after each standard) to provide further clarity.
*   Standards with *specific engineering expectations* are italicized.
*   Many standards contain additional emphasis and example statements that clarify the learning goals for students.
*   Emphasis statements highlight a required and necessary part of the student learning to satisfy that standard.
*   Example statements help to clarify the meaning of the standard and are not required for instruction.

An example of a SEEd standard:

*   **Standard K.2.4** Design and communicate a solution to address the effects that living things (plants and animals, including humans) experience while trying to survive in their surroundings. Define the problem by asking questions and gathering information, convey designs through sketches, drawings, or physical models, and compare designs. Emphasize students working from a plant, animal, or human perspective. Examples could include a plant growing to get more sunlight, a beaver building a dam, or humans caring for the Earth by reusing and recycling natural resources. (ESS3.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

Each part of the above SEEd standard is identified in the following diagram:

## INTRODUCTION

The kindergarten SEEd standards provide a framework for students to obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about how the Sun causes our weather patterns and how these patterns affect living systems. Students analyze information about the needs of living things (plants and animals, including humans) and how living things interact with their surroundings. Students investigate the effects of forces through push and pull interactions. Additionally, students design and evaluate solutions to problems that exist in these areas.

# UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS

## Strand K.1: WEATHER PATTERNS

Weather is the combination of sunlight, wind, snow or rain, and temperature in a particular region at a particular time. People measure these conditions to describe and record the weather to identify patterns over time. Weather scientists forecast severe weather so that communities can prepare for and respond to these events. Sunlight warms Earth’s surface.

*   **Standard K.1.1** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about local, observable weather conditions to describe patterns over time. Emphasize the students’ collection and sharing of data. Examples of data could include sunny, cloudy, windy, rainy, cold, or warm. (ESS2.D)
*   **Standard K.1.2** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information on the effect of forecasted weather patterns on human behavior. Examples could include how humans respond to local forecasts of typical and severe weather such as extreme heat, high winds, flash floods, thunderstorms, or snowstorms. (ESS3.B)
*   **Standard K.1.3** Carry out an investigation using the five senses, to determine the effect of sunlight on different surfaces and materials. Examples could include measuring temperature, through touch or other methods, on natural and man-made materials in various locations throughout the day. (PS3.B)
*   **Standard K.1.4** Design a solution that will reduce the warming effect of sunlight on an area. Define the problem by asking questions and gathering information, convey designs through sketches, drawings, or physical models, and compare and test designs. (PS3.B, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## Strand K.2: LIVING THINGS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS

Living things (plants and animals, including humans) depend on their surroundings to get what they need, including food, water, shelter, and a favorable temperature. The characteristics of surroundings influence where living things are naturally found. Plants and animals affect and respond to their surroundings.

*   **Standard K.2.1** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information to describe patterns of what living things (plants and animals, including humans) need to survive. Emphasize the similarities and differences between the survival needs of all living things. Examples could include that plants depend on air, water, minerals, and light to survive, or animals depend on plants or other animals to survive. (LS1.C, LS2.B)
*   **Standard K.2.2** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about patterns in the relationships between the needs of different living things (plants and animals, including humans) and the places they live. Emphasize that living things need water, air, and resources and that they live in places that have the things they need. Examples could include investigating plants grown in various locations and comparing the results or comparing animals with the places they live. (LS2.A ,LS2.B, ESS3.A)
*   **Standard K.2.3** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about how living things (plants and animals, including humans) affect their surroundings to survive. Examples could include squirrels digging in the ground to hide their food, plant roots breaking concrete, or humans building shelters. (ESS2.E)
*   **Standard K.2.4** Design and communicate a solution to address the effects that living things (plants and animals, including humans) experience while trying to survive in their surroundings. Define the problem by asking questions and gathering information, convey designs through sketches, drawings, or physical models, and compare designs. Emphasize students working from a plant, animal, or human perspective. Examples could include a plant growing to get more sunlight, a beaver building a dam, or humans caring for the Earth by reusing and recycling natural resources. (ESS3.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

# UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS

## Strand K.3: FORCES, MOTION, AND INTERACTIONS

The motion of objects can be observed and described. Pushing or pulling on an object can change the speed or direction of an object’s motion and can start or stop it. Pushes and pulls can have different strengths and different directions. A bigger push or pull makes things go faster and when objects touch or collide, they push on one another and can change motion.

*   **Standard K.3.1** Plan and conduct an investigation to compare the effects of different strengths or different directions of forces on the motion of an object. Emphasize forces as a push and pull on an object. The idea of strength should be kept separate from the idea of direction. Non-contact forces, such as magnets and static electricity, will be taught in Grades 3 through 5. (PS2.A, PS2.B, PS2.C, PS3.C)

*   **Standard K.3.2** Analyze data to determine how a design solution causes a change in the speed or direction of an object with a push or a pull. Define the problem by asking questions and gathering information, convey designs through sketches, drawings, or physical models, and compare and test designs. Examples of problems requiring a solution could include having a marble or other object move a certain distance, follow a particular path, or knock down other objects. (PS2.A, PS2.B, PS2.C, PS3.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## INTRODUCTION

The first-grade SEEd standards provide a framework for students to obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about seasonal and space patterns. Students investigate the needs of all living things including their offspring. Students model and investigate the effects of light and sound on objects or the effects of objects on light and sound. Additionally, students design and evaluate solutions to problems that exist in these areas.

## Strand 1.1: SEASONS AND SPACE PATTERNS

Seasonal patterns of motion of the Sun, Moon, and stars can be observed, described, and predicted. These patterns may vary depending on the region, location, or time of year.

*   **Standard 1.1.1** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about the movement of the Sun, Moon, and stars to describe predictable patterns. Examples of patterns could include how the Sun and Moon appear to rise in one part of the sky, move across the sky, and set; or how stars, other than the Sun, are visible at night but not during the day. (ESS1.A)

*   **Standard 1.1.2** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about the patterns observed at different times of the year to relate the amount of daylight to the time of year. Emphasize the variation in daylight patterns at different times of the day and different times of the year. Examples could include varying locations and regions throughout the state, country, and world. (ESS1.B)

*   **Standard 1.1.3** Design a device that measures the varying patterns of daylight. Define the problem by asking questions and gathering information, convey designs through sketches, drawings, or physical models, and compare and test designs. Examples could include sundials for telling the time or tracking the movement of shadows throughout the day. (ESS1.B, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## Strand 1.2: THE NEEDS OF LIVING THINGS AND THEIR OFFSPRING

Living things (plants and animals, including humans) depend on their surroundings to get what they need, including food, water, shelter, and a favorable temperature. Plants and animals have external features that allow them to survive in a variety of environments. Young plants and animals are similar but not exactly like their parents. In many kinds of animals, parents and offspring engage in behaviors that help the offspring to survive.

*   **Standard 1.2.1** Plan and carry out an investigation to determine the effect of sunlight and water on plant growth. Emphasize investigations that test one variable at a time. (LS1.C, LS2.A)
*   **Standard 1.2.2** Construct an explanation by observing patterns of external features of living things that survive in different locations. Emphasize how plants and nonhuman animals, found in specific surroundings, share similar physical characteristics. Examples could include that plants living in dry areas are more likely to have thick outer coatings that hold in water, animals living in cold locations have longer and thicker fur, or most desert animals are awake at night. (LS1.A, LS1.D)
*   **Standard 1.2.3** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about the patterns of plants and nonhuman animals that are alike, but not exactly like, their parents. An example could include that most carrots are orange and shaped like a cone but may be different sizes or have differing tastes. (LS3.A, LS3.B)
*   **Standard 1.2.4** Construct an explanation of the patterns in the behaviors of parents and offspring which help offspring to survive. Examples of behavioral patterns could include the signals that offspring make such as crying, chirping, and other vocalizations or the responses of the parents such as feeding, comforting, and protecting the offspring. (LS1.B)

# UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS

## Strand 1.3: LIGHT AND SOUND

Sound can make matter vibrate, and vibrating matter can make sound. Objects can only be seen when light is available to illuminate them. Some objects give off their own light. Some materials allow light to pass through them, others allow only some light to pass through them, and still others block light and create a dark shadow on the surface beyond them where the light cannot reach. Mirrors can be used to redirect light. People use a variety of devices that may include sound and light to communicate over long distances.

*   **Standard 1.3.1** Plan and carry out an investigation to show the cause and effect relationship between sound and vibrating matter. Emphasize that vibrating matter can make sound and that sound can make matter vibrate. (PS4.A)
*   **Standard 1.3.2** Use a model to show the effect of light on objects. Emphasize that objects can be seen when light is available to illuminate them or if they give off their own light. (PS4.B)
*   **Standard 1.3.3** Plan and carry out an investigation to determine the effect of materials in the path of a beam of light. Emphasize that light can travel through some materials, can be reflected off some materials, and some materials block light causing shadows. Examples of materials could include clear plastic, wax paper, cardboard, or a mirror. (PS4.B)
*   **Standard 1.3.4** Design a device in which the structure of the device uses light or sound to solve the problem of communicating over a distance. Define the problem by asking questions and gathering information, convey designs through sketches, drawings, or physical models, and compare and test designs. Examples of devices could include a light source to send signals, paper-cup-and-string telephones, or a pattern of drum beats. (PS4.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## Strand 2.1: CHANGES IN THE EARTH'S SURFACE

Earth has an ancient history of slow and gradual surface changes, punctuated with quick but powerful geologic events like volcanic eruptions, flooding, and earthquakes. Water and wind play a significant role in changing Earth's surface. The effects of wind and water can cause both slow and quick changes to the surface of the Earth. Scientists and engineers design solutions to slow or prevent wind or water from changing the land.

*   **Standard 2.1.1** Develop and use models illustrating the patterns of landforms and water on Earth. Examples of models could include valleys, canyons, or floodplains and could depict water in the solid or liquid state. (ESS2.B, ESS2.C)
*   **Standard 2.1.2** Construct an explanation about changes in Earth's surface that happen quickly or slowly. Emphasize the contrast between fast and slow changes. Examples of fast changes could include volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or landslides. Examples of slow changes could include the erosion of mountains or the shaping of canyons. (ESS1.C)
*   **Standard 2.1.3** Design solutions to slow or prevent wind or water from changing the shape of land. Define the problem by asking questions and gathering information, convey designs through sketches, drawings, or physical models, and compare and test designs. Examples of solutions could include retaining walls, dikes, windbreaks, shrubs, trees, and grass to hold back wind, water, and land. (ESS2.A, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

GRADE 2 | &lt;page_number&gt;26&lt;/page_number&gt;

# UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS

## Strand 2.2: LIVING THINGS AND THEIR HABITATS

Living things (plants and animals, including humans) need water, air, and resources from the land to survive and live in habitats that provide these necessities. The physical characteristics of plants and animals reflect the habitat in which they live. Animals also have modified behaviors that help them survive, grow, and meet their needs. Humans sometimes mimic plant and animal adaptations to survive in their environment.

*   **Standard 2.2.1** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about patterns of living things (plants and animals, including humans) in different habitats. Emphasize the diversity of living things in land and water habitats. Examples of patterns in habitats could include descriptions of temperature or precipitation and the types of plants and animals found in land habitats. (LS2.C, LS4.C, LS4.D)
*   **Standard 2.2.2** Plan and carry out an investigation of the structure and function of plant and animal parts in different habitats. Emphasize how different plants and animals have different structures to survive in their habitat. Examples could include the shallow roots of a cactus in the desert or the seasonal changes in the fur coat of a wolf. (LS1.A, LS4.C, LS4.D)
*   **Standard 2.2.3** Develop and use a model that mimics the function of an animal dispersing seeds or pollinating plants. Examples could include plants that have seeds with hooks or barbs that attach themselves to animal fur, feathers, or human clothing, or dispersal through the wind, or consumption of fruit and the disposal of the pits or seeds. (LS2.A)
*   **Standard 2.2.4** Design a solution to a human problem by mimicking the structure and function of plants and/or animals and how they use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs. Define the problem by asking questions and gathering information, convey designs through sketches, drawings, or physical models, and compare and test designs. Examples could include a human wearing a jacket to mimic the fur of an animal or a webbed foot to design a better swimming fin. (LS1.A, LS1.D, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## Strand 2.3: PROPERTIES OF MATTER

All things are made of matter which exists with different forms and properties. Matter can be described and classified by its observable properties. Materials with certain properties are well-suited for specific uses. Heating or cooling some types of matter may or may not irreversibly change their properties.

*   **Standard 2.3.1** Plan and carry out an investigation to classify different kinds of materials based on patterns in their observable properties. Examples could include sorting materials based on similar properties such as strength, color, flexibility, hardness, texture, or whether the materials are solids or liquids. (PS1.A)
*   **Standard 2.3.2** Construct an explanation showing how the properties of materials influence their intended use and function. Examples could include using wood as a building material because it is lightweight and strong or the use of concrete, steel, or cotton due to their unique properties. (PS1.A)
*   **Standard 2.3.3** Develop and use a model to describe how an object, made of a small set of pieces, can be disassembled and reshaped into a new object with a different function. Emphasize that a great variety of objects can be built from a small set of pieces. Examples of pieces could include wooden blocks or building bricks. (PS1.A)
*   **Standard 2.3.4** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about changes in matter caused by heating or cooling. Emphasize that some changes can be reversed and some cannot.

## Strand 3.1: WEATHER AND CLIMATE PATTERNS

Weather is a minute-by-minute, day-by-day variation of the atmosphere's condition on a local scale. Scientists record patterns of weather across different times and areas so that they can make weather forecasts. Climate describes a range of an area's typical weather conditions and the extent to which those conditions vary over a long period of time. A variety of weather-related hazards result from natural processes. While humans cannot eliminate natural hazards, they can take steps to reduce their impact.

*   **Standard 3.1.1** Analyze and interpret data to reveal patterns that indicate typical weather conditions expected during a particular season. Emphasize students gathering data in a variety of ways and representing data in tables and graphs. Examples of data could include temperature, precipitation, or wind speed. (ESS2.D)
*   **Standard 3.1.2** Obtain and communicate information to describe climate patterns in different regions of the world. Emphasize how climate patterns can be used to predict typical weather conditions. Examples of climate patterns could be average seasonal temperature and average seasonal precipitation. (ESS2.D)
*   **Standard 3.1.3** Design a solution that reduces the effects of a weather-related hazard. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, develop possible solutions, analyze data from testing solutions, and propose modifications for optimizing a solution. Examples could include barriers to prevent flooding or wind-resistant roofs. (ESS3.B, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## Strand 3.2: EFFECTS OF TRAITS ON SURVIVAL

Organisms (plants and animals, including humans) have unique and diverse life cycles, but they all follow a pattern of birth, growth, reproduction, and death. Different organisms vary in how they look and function because they have different inherited traits. An organism’s traits are inherited from its parents and can be influenced by the environment. Variations in traits between individuals in a population may provide advantages in surviving and reproducing in particular environments. When the environment changes, some organisms have traits that allow them to survive, some move to new locations, and some do not survive. Humans can design solutions to reduce the impact of environmental changes on organisms.

*   **Standard 3.2.1** Develop and use models to describe changes that organisms go through during their life cycles. Emphasize that organisms have unique and diverse life cycles but follow a pattern of birth, growth, reproduction, and death. Examples of changes in life cycles could include how some plants and animals look different at different stages of life or how other plants and animals only appear to change size in their life. (LS1.B)
*   **Standard 3.2.2** Analyze and interpret data to identify patterns of traits that plants and animals have inherited from parents. Emphasize the similarities and differences in traits between parent organisms and offspring and variation of traits in groups of similar organisms. (LS3.A, LS3.B)
*   **Standard 3.2.3** Construct an explanation that the environment can affect the traits of an organism. Examples could include that the growth of normally tall plants is stunted with insufficient water or that pets given too much food and little exercise may become overweight. (LS3.B)
*   **Standard 3.2.4** Construct an explanation showing how variations in traits and behaviors can affect the ability of an individual to survive and reproduce. Examples of traits could include large thorns protecting a plant from being eaten or strong smelling flowers to attracting certain pollinators. Examples of behaviors could include animals living in groups for protection or migrating to find more food. (LS2.D, LS4.B)
*   **Standard 3.2.5** Engage in argument from evidence that in a particular habitat (system) some organisms can survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all. Emphasize that organisms and habitats form systems in which the parts depend upon each other. Examples of evidence could include needs and characteristics of the organisms and habitats involved such as cacti growing in dry, sandy soil but not surviving in wet, saturated soil. (LS4.C)
*   **Standard 3.2.6** Design a solution to a problem caused by a change in the environment that impacts the types of plants and animals living in that environment. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, and develop possible solutions. Examples of environmental changes could include changes in land use, water availability, temperature, food, or changes caused by other organisms. (LS2.C, LS4.D, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## Strand 3.3: FORCE AFFECTS MOTION

Forces act on objects and have both a strength and a direction. An object at rest typically has multiple forces acting on it, but they are balanced, resulting in a zero net force on the object. Forces that are unbalanced can cause changes in an object’s speed or direction of motion. The patterns of an object’s motion in various situations can be observed, measured, and used to predict future motion. Forces are exerted when objects come in contact with each other; however, some forces can act on objects that are not in contact. The gravitational force of Earth, acting on an object near Earth’s surface, pulls that object toward the planet’s center. Electric and magnetic forces between a pair of objects can act at a distance. The strength of these non-contact forces depends on the properties of the objects and the distance between the objects.

*   **Standard 3.3.1** Plan and carry out investigations that provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object. Emphasize investigations where only one variable is tested at a time. Examples could include an unbalanced force on one side of a ball causing it to move and balanced forces pushing on a box from both sides producing no movement. (PS2.A, PS2.B)
*   **Standard 3.3.2** Analyze and interpret data from observations and measurements of an object’s motion to identify patterns in its motion that can be used to predict future motion. Examples of motion with a predictable pattern could include a child swinging on a swing or a ball rolling down a ramp. (PS2.A, PS2.C)
*   **Standard 3.3.3** Construct an explanation that the gravitational force exerted by Earth causes objects to be directed downward, toward the center of the spherical Earth. Emphasize that “downward” is a local description depending on one’s position on Earth. (PS2.B)
*   **Standard 3.3.4** Ask questions to plan and carry out an investigation to determine cause and effect relationships of electric or magnetic interactions between two objects not in contact with each other. Emphasize how static electricity and magnets can cause objects to move without touching. Examples could include the force an electrically charged balloon has on hair, how magnet orientation affects the direction of a force, or how distance between objects affects the strength of a force. Electrical charges and magnetic fields will be taught in Grades 6 through 8. (PS2.B)
*   **Standard 3.3.5** Design a solution to a problem in which a device functions by using scientific ideas about magnets. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, develop possible solutions using models, analyze data from testing solutions, and propose modifications for optimizing a solution. Examples could include a latch or lock used to keep a door shut or a device to keep two moving objects from touching each other. (PS2.B, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

# UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS

## Strand 4.1: ORGANISMS FUNCTIONING IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT

Through the study of organisms, inferences can be made about environments both past and present. Plants and animals have both internal and external structures that serve various functions for growth, survival, behavior, and reproduction. Animals use different sense receptors specialized for particular kinds of information to understand and respond to their environment. Some kinds of plants and animals that once lived on Earth can no longer be found. However, fossils from these organisms provide evidence about the types of organisms that lived long ago and the nature of their environments. Additionally, the presence and location of certain fossil types indicate changes that have occurred in environments over time.

*   **Standard 4.1.1** Construct an explanation from evidence that plants and animals have internal and external structures that function to support survival, growth, behavior, and reproduction. Emphasize how structures support an organism’s survival in its environment and how internal and external structures of plants and animals vary within the same and across multiple Utah environments. Examples of structures could include thorns on a stem to prevent predation or gills on a fish to allow it to breathe underwater. (LS1.A)
*   **Standard 4.1.2** Develop and use a model of a system to describe how animals receive different types of information from their environment through their senses, process the information in their brain, and respond to the information. Emphasize how animals are able to use their perceptions and memories to guide their actions. Examples could include models that explain how animals sense and then respond to different aspects of their environment such as sounds, temperature, or smell. (LS1.D)
*   **Standard 4.1.3** Analyze and interpret data from fossils to provide evidence of the stability and change in organisms and environments from long ago. Emphasize using the structures of fossils to make inferences about ancient organisms. Examples of fossils and environments could include comparing a trilobite with a horseshoe crab in an ocean environment or using a fossil footprint to determine the size of a dinosaur. (LS4.A)
*   **Standard 4.1.4** Engage in argument from evidence based on patterns in rock layers and fossils found in those layers to support an explanation that environments have changed over time. Emphasize the relationship between fossils and past environments. Examples could include tropical plant fossils found in Arctic areas and rock layers with marine shell fossils found above rock layers with land plant fossils. (ESS1.C)

## Strand 4.2: ENERGY TRANSFER

Energy is present whenever there are moving objects, sound, light, or heat. The faster a given object is moving, the more energy it possesses. When objects collide, energy can be transferred from one object to another causing the objects’ motions to change. Energy can also be transferred from place to place by electrical currents, heat, sound, or light. Devices can be designed to convert energy from one form to another.

*   **Standard 4.2.1** Construct an explanation to describe the cause and effect relationship between the speed of an object and the energy of that object. Emphasize using qualitative descriptions of the relationship between speed and energy like fast, slow, strong, or weak. An example could include a ball that is kicked hard has more energy and travels a greater distance than a ball that is kicked softly. (PS3.A)
*   **Standard 4.2.2** Ask questions and make observations about the changes in energy that occur when objects collide. Emphasize that energy is transferred when objects collide and may be converted to different forms of energy. Examples could include changes in speed when one moving ball collides with another or the transfer of energy when a toy car hits a wall. (PS3.B, PS3.C)
*   **Standard 4.2.3** Plan and carry out an investigation to gather evidence from observations that energy can be transferred from place to place by sound, light, heat, and electrical currents. Examples could include sound causing objects to vibrate and electric currents being used to produce motion or light. (PS3.A, PS3.B)
*   **Standard 4.2.4** Design a device that converts energy from one form to another. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, develop possible solutions using models, analyze data from testing solutions, and propose modifications for optimizing a solution. Emphasize identifying the initial and final forms of energy. Examples could include solar ovens that convert light energy to heat energy or a simple alarm system that converts motion energy into sound energy. (PS3.B, PS3.D, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## Strand 4.3: WAVE PATTERNS

Waves are regular patterns of motion that transfer energy and have properties such as amplitude (maximum distance of the wave crest from equilibrium) and wavelength (spacing between wave peaks). Waves in water can be directly observed. Light waves cause objects to be seen when light reflected from objects enters the eye. Humans use waves and other patterns to transfer information.

*   **Standard 4.3.1** Develop and use a model to describe the regular patterns of waves. Emphasize patterns in terms of amplitude and wavelength. Examples of models could include diagrams, analogies, and physical models such as water or rope. (PS4.A)
*   **Standard 4.3.2** Develop and use a model to describe how visible light waves reflected from objects enter the eye causing objects to be seen. Emphasize the reflection and movement of light. The structure and function of organs and organ systems and the relationship between color and wavelength will be taught in Grades 6 through 8. (PS4.B)
*   **Standard 4.3.3** Design a solution to an information transfer problem using wave patterns. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, develop possible solutions using models, analyze data from testing solutions, and propose modifications for optimizing a solution. Examples could include using light to transmit a message in Morse code or using lenses and mirrors to see objects that are far away. (PS4.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## Strand 4.4: OBSERVABLE PATTERNS IN THE SKY

The Sun is a star that appears larger and brighter than other stars because it is closer to Earth. The rotation of Earth on its axis and orbit of Earth around the Sun cause observable patterns. These include day and night; daily changes in the length and direction of shadows; and different positions of the Sun and stars at different times of the day, month, and year.

*   **Standard 4.4.1** Construct an explanation that differences in the apparent brightness of the Sun compared to other stars is due to the relative distance (scale) of stars from Earth. Emphasize relative distance from Earth. (ESS1.A)
*   **Standard 4.4.2** Analyze and interpret data of observable patterns to show that Earth rotates on its axis and revolves around the Sun. Emphasize patterns that provide evidence of Earth’s rotation and orbits around the Sun. Examples of patterns could include day and night, daily changes in length and direction of shadows, and seasonal appearance of some stars in the night sky. Earth’s seasons and its connection to the tilt of Earth’s axis will be taught in Grades 6 through 8. (ESS1.B)

## Strand 5.1: CHARACTERISTICS AND INTERACTIONS OF EARTH'S SYSTEMS

Earth's major systems are the geosphere (solid and molten rock, soil, and sediments), the hydrosphere (water and ice), the atmosphere (air), and the biosphere (living things, including humans). Within these systems, the location of Earth's land and water can be described. Also, these systems interact in multiple ways. Weathering and erosion are examples of interactions between Earth's systems. Some interactions cause landslides, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions that impact humans and other organisms. Humans cannot eliminate natural hazards, but solutions can be designed to reduce their impact.

*   **Standard 5.1.1** Analyze and interpret data to describe patterns of Earth's features.
    Emphasize most earthquakes and volcanoes occur in bands that are often along the boundaries between continents and oceans while major mountain chains may be found inside continents or near their edges. Examples of data could include maps showing locations of mountains on continents and the ocean floor or the locations of volcanoes and earthquakes. (ESS2.B)

*   **Standard 5.1.2** Use mathematics and computational thinking to compare the quantity of saltwater and freshwater in various reservoirs to provide evidence for the distribution of water on Earth. Emphasize reservoirs such as oceans, lakes, rivers, glaciers, groundwater, and polar ice caps. Examples of using mathematics and computational thinking could include measuring, estimating, graphing, or finding percentages of quantities. (ESS2.C)

*   **Standard 5.1.3** Ask questions to plan and carry out investigations that provide evidence for the effects of weathering and the rate of erosion on the geosphere. Emphasize weathering and erosion by water, ice, wind, gravity, or vegetation. Examples could include observing the effects of cycles of freezing and thawing of water on rock or changing the slope in the downhill movement of water. (ESS2.A, ESS2.E)

*   **Standard 5.1.4** Develop a model to describe interactions between Earth's systems including the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere. Emphasize interactions between only two systems at a time. Examples could include the influence of a rainstorm in a desert, waves on a shoreline, or mountains on clouds. (ESS2.A)

*   **Standard 5.1.5** Design solutions to reduce the effects of naturally occurring events that impact humans. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, develop possible solutions using models, analyze data from testing solutions, and propose modifications for optimizing a solution. Emphasize that humans cannot eliminate natural hazards, but they can take steps to reduce their impacts. Examples of events could include landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, blizzards, or volcanic eruptions. (ESS3.B, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## Strand 5.2: PROPERTIES AND CHANGES OF MATTER

All substances are composed of matter. Matter is made of particles that are too small to be seen but still exist and can be detected by other means. Substances have specific properties by which they can be identified. When two or more different substances are combined a new substance with different properties may be formed. Whether a change results in a new substance or not, the total amount of matter is always conserved.

*   **Standard 5.2.1** Develop and use a model to describe that matter is made of particles on a scale that is too small to be seen. Emphasize making observations of changes supported by a particle model of matter. Examples could include adding air to expand a balloon, compressing air in a syringe, adding food coloring to water, or dissolving salt in water and evaporating the water. The use of the terms atoms and molecules will be taught in Grades 6 through 8. (PS1.A)
*   **Standard 5.2.2** Ask questions to plan and carry out investigations to identify substances based on patterns of their properties. Emphasize using properties to identify substances. Examples of properties could include color, hardness, conductivity, solubility, or a response to magnetic forces. Examples of substances could include powders, metals, minerals, or liquids. (PS1.A)
*   **Standard 5.2.3** Plan and carry out investigations to determine the effect of combining two or more substances. Emphasize whether a new substance is or is not created by the formation of a new substance with different properties. Examples could include combining vinegar and baking soda or rusting an iron nail in water. (PS1.B)
*   **Standard 5.2.4** Use mathematics and computational thinking to provide evidence that regardless of the type of change that occurs when heating, cooling, or combining substances, the total weight of matter is conserved. Examples could include melting an ice cube, dissolving salt in water, and combining baking soda and vinegar in a closed bag. (PS1.A, PS1.B)

## Strand 5.3: CYCLING OF MATTER IN ECOSYSTEMS

Matter cycles within ecosystems and can be traced from organism to organism. Plants use energy from the Sun to change air and water into matter needed for growth. Animals and decomposers consume matter for their life functions, continuing the cycling of matter. Human behavior can affect the cycling of matter. Scientists and engineers design solutions to conserve Earth's environments and resources.

*   **Standard 5.3.1** Construct an explanation that plants use air, water, and energy from sunlight to produce plant matter needed for growth. Emphasize photosynthesis at a conceptual level and that plant matter comes mostly from air and water, not from the soil. Photosynthesis at the cellular level will be taught in Grades 6 through 8. (LS1.C)
*   **Standard 5.3.2** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information that animals obtain energy and matter from the food they eat for body repair, growth, and motion and to maintain body warmth. Emphasize that the energy used by animals was once energy from the Sun. Cellular respiration will be taught in Grades 6 through 8. (PS3.D, LS1.C)
*   **Standard 5.3.3** Develop and use a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment. Emphasize that matter cycles between the air and soil and among plants, animals, and microbes as these organisms live and die. Examples could include simple food chains from ecosystems such as deserts or oceans or diagrams of decomposers returning matter to the environment. Complex interactions in a food web will be taught in Grades 6 through 8. (LS2.A, LS2.B)
*   **Standard 5.3.4** Evaluate design solutions whose primary function is to conserve Earth's environments and resources. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, analyze available data on proposed solutions, and determine an optimal solution. Emphasize how humans can balance everyday needs (agriculture, industry, and energy) while conserving Earth's environments and resources. (ESS3.A, ESS3.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## INTRODUCTION

The sixth-grade SEEd standards provide a framework for student understanding of the cycling of matter and the flow of energy through the study of observable phenomena on Earth. Students will explore the role of energy and gravity in the solar system as they compare the scale and properties of objects in the solar system and model the Sun-Earth-Moon system. These strands also emphasize heat energy as it affects some properties of matter, including states of matter and density. The relationship between heat energy and matter is observable in many phenomena on Earth, such as seasons, the water cycle, weather, and climates. Types of ecosystems on Earth are dependent upon the interaction of organisms with each other and with the physical environment. By researching interactions between the living and nonliving components of ecosystems, students will understand how the flow of energy and cycling of matter affects stability and change within their environment.

## Strand 6.1: STRUCTURE AND MOTION WITHIN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

The solar system consists of the Sun, planets, and other objects within Sun’s gravitational influence. Gravity is the force of attraction between masses. The Sun-Earth-Moon system provides an opportunity to study interactions between objects in the solar system that influence phenomena observed from Earth. Scientists use data from many sources to determine the scale and properties of objects in our solar system.

*   **Standard 6.1.1** Develop and use a model of the Sun-Earth-Moon system to describe the cyclic patterns of lunar phases, eclipses of the Sun and Moon, and seasons. Examples of models could be physical, graphical, or conceptual. (ESS1.A, ESS1.B)
*   **Standard 6.1.2** Develop and use a model to describe the role of gravity and inertia in orbital motions of objects in our solar system. (ESS1.B)
*   **Standard 6.1.3** Use computational thinking to analyze data and determine the scale and properties of objects in the solar system. Examples of scale could include size or distance. Examples of properties could include layers, temperature, surface features, or orbital radius. Data sources could include Earth and space-based instruments such as telescopes or satellites. Types of data could include graphs, data tables, drawings, photographs, or models. (ESS1.A, ESS1.B)

## Strand 6.2: ENERGY AFFECTS MATTER

Matter and energy are fundamental components of the universe. Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space. Transfer of energy creates change in matter. Changes between general states of matter can occur through the transfer of energy. Density describes how closely matter is packed together. Substances with a higher density have more matter in a given space than substances with a lower density. Changes in heat energy can alter the density of a material. Insulators resist the transfer of heat energy, while conductors easily transfer heat energy. These differences in energy flow can be used to design products to meet the needs of society.

*   **Standard 6.2.1** Develop models to show that molecules are made of different kinds, proportions, and quantities of atoms. Emphasize understanding that there are differences between atoms and molecules, and that certain combinations of atoms form specific molecules. Examples of simple molecules could include water (H₂O), atmospheric oxygen (O₂), or carbon dioxide (CO₂). (PS1.A)
*   **Standard 6.2.2** Develop a model to predict the effect of heat energy on states of matter and density. Emphasize the arrangement of particles in states of matter (solid, liquid, or gas) and during phase changes (melting, freezing, condensing, and evaporating). (PS1.A, PS3.A)
*   **Standard 6.2.3** Plan and carry out an investigation to determine the relationship between temperature, the amount of heat transferred, and the change of average particle motion in various types or amounts of matter. Emphasize recording and evaluating data, and communicating the results of the investigation. (PS3.A)
*   **Standard 6.2.4** Design an object, tool, or process that minimizes or maximizes heat energy transfer. Identify criteria and constraints, develop a prototype for iterative testing, analyze data from testing, and propose modifications for optimizing the design solution. Emphasize demonstrating how the structure of differing materials allows them to function as either conductors or insulators. (PS3.A, PS3.B, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## Strand 6.3: EARTH'S WEATHER PATTERNS AND CLIMATE

All Earth processes are the result of energy flowing and matter cycling within and among the planet's systems. Heat energy from the Sun, transmitted by radiation, is the primary source of energy that affects Earth's weather and drives the water cycle. Uneven heating across Earth's surface causes changes in density, which result in convection currents in water and air, creating patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that determine regional and global climates.

*   **Standard 6.3.1** Develop a model to describe how the cycling of water through Earth's systems is driven by energy from the Sun, gravitational forces, and density. (ESS2.C)
*   **Standard 6.3.2** Investigate the interactions between air masses that cause changes in weather conditions. Collect and analyze weather data to provide evidence for how air masses flow from regions of high pressure to low pressure causing a change in weather. Examples of data collection could include field observations, laboratory experiments, weather maps, or diagrams. (ESS2.C, ESS2.D)
*   **Standard 6.3.3** Develop and use a model to show how unequal heating of the Earth's systems causes patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that determine regional climates.

## Strand 6.4: STABILITY AND CHANGE IN ECOSYSTEMS

The study of ecosystems includes the interaction of organisms with each other and with the physical environment. Consistent interactions occur within and between species in various ecosystems as organisms obtain resources, change the environment, and are affected by the environment. This influences the flow of energy through an ecosystem, resulting in system variations. Additionally, ecosystems benefit humans through processes and resources, such as the production of food, water and air purification, and recreation opportunities. Scientists and engineers investigate interactions among organisms and evaluate design solutions to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem resources.

*   **Standard 6.4.1** Analyze data to provide evidence for the effects of resource availability on organisms and populations in an ecosystem. Ask questions to predict how changes in resource availability affects organisms in those ecosystems. Examples could include water, food, or living space in Utah environments. (LS2.A)
*   **Standard 6.4.2** Construct an explanation that predicts patterns of interactions among organisms across multiple ecosystems. Emphasize consistent interactions in different environments such as competition, predation, and mutualism. (LS2.A)
*   **Standard 6.4.3** Develop a model to describe the cycling of matter and flow of energy among living and nonliving parts of an ecosystem. Emphasize food webs and the role of producers, consumers, and decomposers in various ecosystems. Examples could include Utah ecosystems such as mountains, Great Salt Lake, wetlands, or deserts. (LS2.B)
*   **Standard 6.4.4** Construct an argument supported by evidence that the stability of populations is affected by changes to an ecosystem. Emphasize how changes to living and nonliving components in an ecosystem affect populations in that ecosystem. Examples could include Utah ecosystems such as mountains, Great Salt Lake, wetlands, or deserts. (LS2.C)
*   **Standard 6.4.5** Evaluate competing design solutions for preserving ecosystem services that protect resources and biodiversity based on how well the solutions maintain stability within the ecosystem. Emphasize obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information of differing design solutions. Examples could include policies affecting ecosystems, responding to invasive species, or solutions for the preservation of ecosystem resources specific to Utah, such as air and water quality and prevention of soil erosion. (LS2.C, LS4.D, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## INTRODUCTION

The seventh-grade SEEd standards look for relationships of cause and effect which enable students to pinpoint mechanisms of nature and allow them to make predictions. Students will explore how forces can cause changes in motion and are responsible for the transfer of energy and the cycling of matter. This takes place within and between a wide variety of systems from simple, short-term forces on individual objects to the deep, long-term forces that shape our planet. In turn, Earth’s environments provide the conditions for life as we know it. Organisms survive and reproduce only to the extent that their own mechanisms and adaptations allow. Evidence for the evolutionary histories of life on Earth is provided through the fossil record, similarities in the various structures among species, organism development, and genetic similarities across all organisms. Additionally, mechanisms shaping Earth are understood as forces affecting the cycling of Earth’s materials. Questions about cause and effect and the ongoing search for evidence in science, or science’s ongoing search for evidence, drive this storyline.

## Strand 7.1: FORCES ARE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MATTER

Forces are push or pull interactions between two objects. Changes in motion, balance and stability, and transfers of energy are all facilitated by forces on matter. Forces, including electric, magnetic, and gravitational forces, can act on objects that are not in contact with each other. Scientists use data from many sources to examine the cause and effect relationships determined by different forces.

*   **Standard 7.1.1** Carry out an investigation which provides evidence that a change in an object’s motion is dependent on the mass of the object and the sum of the forces acting on it. *Various experimental designs should be evaluated to determine how well the investigation measures an object’s motion.* Emphasize conceptual understanding of Newton’s First and Second Laws. Calculations will only focus on one-dimensional movement; the use of vectors will be introduced in high school. (PS2.A, PS2.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)
*   **Standard 7.1.2** Apply Newton’s Third Law to *design a solution* to a problem involving the motion of two colliding objects in a system. Examples could include collisions between two moving objects or between a moving object and a stationary object. (PS2.A, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)
*   **Standard 7.1.3** Construct a model using observational evidence to describe the nature of fields existing between objects that exert forces on each other even though the objects are not in contact. Emphasize the *cause and effect* relationship between properties of objects (such as magnets or electrically charged objects) and the forces they exert. (PS2.B)
*   **Standard 7.1.4** Collect and analyze data to determine the factors that affect the strength of electric and magnetic forces. Examples could include electromagnets, electric motors, or generators. Examples of data could include the effect of the number of turns of wire on the strength of an electromagnet, or of increasing the number or strength of magnets on the speed of an electric motor. (PS2.B)
*   **Standard 7.1.5** Engage in argument from evidence to support the claim that gravitational interactions within a system are attractive and dependent upon the masses of interacting objects. Examples of evidence for arguments could include mathematical data generated from various simulations. (PS2.B)

## Strand 7.2: CHANGES TO EARTH OVER TIME

Earth's processes are dynamic and interactive and are the result of energy flowing and matter cycling within and among Earth's systems. Energy from the sun and Earth's internal heat are the main sources driving these processes. Plate tectonics is a unifying theory that explains crustal movements of Earth's surface, how and where different rocks form, the occurrence of earthquakes and volcanoes, and the distribution of fossil plants and animals.

*   **Standard 7.2.1** Develop a model of the rock cycle to describe the relationship between energy flow and matter cycling that create igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. Emphasize the processes of melting, crystallization, weathering, deposition, sedimentation, and deformation, which act together to form minerals and rocks. (ESS1.C, ESS2.A)
*   **Standard 7.2.2** Construct an explanation based on evidence for how processes have changed Earth's surface at varying time and spatial scales. Examples of processes that occur at varying time scales could include slow plate motions or rapid landslides. Examples of processes that occur at varying spatial scales could include uplift of a mountain range or deposition of fine sediments. (ESS2.A, ESS2.C)
*   **Standard 7.2.3** Ask questions to identify constraints of specific geologic hazards and evaluate competing design solutions for maintaining the stability of human-engineered structures, such as homes, roads, and bridges. Examples of geologic hazards could include earthquakes, landslides, or floods. (ESS2.A, ESS2.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)
*   **Standard 7.2.4** Develop and use a scale model of the matter in the Earth's interior to demonstrate how differences in density and chemical composition (silicon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium) cause the formation of the crust, mantle, and core. (ESS2.A)
*   **Standard 7.2.5** Ask questions and analyze and interpret data about the patterns between plate tectonics and:
    *   (1) The occurrence of earthquakes and volcanoes.
    *   (2) Continental and ocean floor features.
    *   (3) The distribution of rocks and fossils.
    Examples could include identifying patterns on maps of earthquakes and volcanoes relative to plate boundaries, the shapes of the continents, the locations of ocean structures (including mountains, volcanoes, faults, and trenches), or similarities of rock and fossil types on different continents. (ESS1.C, ESS2.B)
*   **Standard 7.2.6** Make an argument from evidence for how the geologic time scale shows the age and history of Earth. Emphasize scientific evidence from rock strata, the fossil record, and the principles of relative dating, such as superposition, uniformitarianism, and recognizing unconformities. (ESS1.C)

## Strand 7.3: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF LIFE

Living things are made of smaller structures, which function to meet the needs of survival. The basic structural unit of all living things is the cell. Parts of a cell work together to function as a system. Cells work together and form tissues, organs, and organ systems. Organ systems interact to meet the needs of the organism.

*   **Standard 7.3.1** Plan and carry out an investigation that provides evidence that the basic structures of living things are cells. Emphasize that cells can form single-celled or multicellular organisms, and multicellular organisms are made of different types of cells. (LS1.A)

Emphasize the cell as a system, including the interrelating roles of the nucleus, chloroplasts, mitochondria, cell membrane, and cell wall. (LS1.A)
*   **Standard 7.3.3** Construct an explanation using evidence to explain how body systems have various levels of organization. Emphasize that cells form tissues, tissues form organs, and organs form systems specialized for particular body functions. Examples could include relationships between the circulatory, excretory, digestive, respiratory, muscular, skeletal, or nervous systems. Specific organ functions will be taught at the high school level. (LS1.A)

## Strand 7.4: REPRODUCTION AND INHERITANCE

The great diversity of species on Earth is a result of genetic variation. Genetic traits are passed from parent to offspring. These traits affect the structure and behavior of organisms, which affect the organism's ability to survive and reproduce. Mutations can cause changes in traits that may affect an organism. As technology has developed, humans have been able to change the inherited traits in organisms, which may have an impact on society.

*   **Standard 7.4.1** Develop and use a model to explain the effects that different types of reproduction have on genetic variation. Emphasize genetic variation through asexual and sexual reproduction. (LS1.B, LS3.A, LS3.B)
*   **Standard 7.4.2** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about specific animal and plant adaptations and structures that affect the probability of successful reproduction. Examples of adaptations could include nest building to protect young from the cold, herding of animals to protect young from predators, vocalization of animals and colorful plumage to attract mates for breeding, bright flowers attracting butterflies that transfer pollen, flower nectar and odors that attract insects that transfer pollen, or hard shells on nuts that squirrels bury. (LS1.B)
*   **Standard 7.4.3** Develop and use a model to describe why genetic mutations may result in harmful, beneficial, or neutral effects to the structure and function of the organism. Emphasize the conceptual idea that changes to traits can happen because of genetic mutations. Specific changes of genes at the molecular level, mechanisms for protein synthesis, and specific types of mutations will be introduced at the high school level. (LS3.A, LS3.B)
*   **Standard 7.4.4** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about the technologies that have changed the way humans affect the inheritance of desired traits in organisms. Analyze data from tests or simulations to determine the best solution to achieve success in cultivating selected desired traits in organisms.

## Strand 7.5: CHANGES IN SPECIES OVER TIME

Genetic variation and the proportion of traits within a population can change over time. These changes can result in evolution through natural selection. Additional evidence of change over time can be found in the fossil record, anatomical similarities and differences between modern and ancient organisms, and embryological development.

*   **Standard 7.5.1** Construct an explanation that describes how the genetic variation of traits in a population can affect some individuals’ probability of surviving and reproducing in a specific environment. Over time, specific traits may increase or decrease in populations. Emphasize the use of proportional reasoning to support explanations of trends in changes to populations over time.

# GRADE 8

## INTRODUCTION

The eighth-grade SEEd standards describe the constant interaction of matter and energy in nature. Students will explore how matter is arranged into either simple or complex substances. The strands emphasize how substances store and transfer energy which can cause them to interact physically and chemically, provide energy to living organisms, or be harnessed and used by humans. Matter and energy cycle and change in ecosystems through processes that occur during photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Additionally, substances that provide a benefit to organisms, including humans, are unevenly distributed on Earth due to geologic and atmospheric systems. Some resources form quickly, allowing them to be renewable, while other resources are nonrenewable. Evidence reveals that Earth’s systems change and affect ecosystems and organisms in positive and negative ways.

## Strand 8.1: MATTER AND ENERGY INTERACT IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD

The physical world is made of atoms and molecules. Even large objects can be viewed as a combination of small particles. Energy causes particles to move and interact physically or chemically. Those interactions create a variety of substances. As molecules undergo a chemical or physical change, the number of atoms in that system remains constant. Humans use energy to refine natural resources into synthetic materials.

*   **Standard 8.1.1** Develop a model to describe the scale and proportion of atoms and molecules.

(PS3.A)
*   **Standard 8.1.6** Develop a model to describe how the total number of atoms does not change in a chemical reaction, indicating that matter is conserved. Emphasize demonstrations of an understanding of the law of conservation of matter. Balancing equations and stoichiometry will be learned at the high school level. (PS1.B)

## Strand 8.2: ENERGY IS STORED AND TRANSFERRED IN PHYSICAL SYSTEMS

Objects can store and transfer energy within systems. Energy can be transferred between objects, which involves changes in the object’s energy. There is a direct relationship between an object’s energy, mass, and velocity. Energy can travel in waves and may be harnessed to transmit information.

*   **Standard 8.2.1** Use computational thinking to analyze data about the relationship between the mass and speed of objects and the relative amount of kinetic energy of the objects. Emphasis should be on the quantity of mass and relative speed to the observable effects of the kinetic energy. Examples could include a full cart vs. an empty cart or rolling spheres with different masses down a ramp to measure the effects on stationary masses. Calculations of kinetic and potential energy will be learned at the high school level. (PS3.A)

*   **Standard 8.2.2** Ask questions about how the amount of potential energy varies as distance within the system changes. Plan and conduct an investigation to answer a question about potential energy. Emphasize comparing relative amounts of energy. Examples could include a cart at varying positions on a hill or an object being dropped from different heights. Calculations of kinetic and potential energy will be learned at the high school level. (PS3.A, PS3.C)

*   **Standard 8.2.3** Engage in argument to identify the strongest evidence that supports the claim that the kinetic energy of an object changes as energy is transferred to or from the object.

(PS4.A, PS4.B)

*   **Standard 8.2.6** Obtain and evaluate information to communicate the claim that the structure of digital signals are a more reliable way to store or transmit information than analog signals. Emphasize the basic understanding that waves can be used for communication purposes. Examples could include using vinyl record vs. digital song files, film cameras vs. digital cameras, or alcohol thermometers vs. digital thermometers. (PS4.C)

## Strand 8.3: LIFE SYSTEMS STORE AND TRANSFER MATTER AND ENERGY

Living things use energy from their environment to rearrange matter to sustain life. Photosynthetic organisms are able to transfer light energy to chemical energy. Consumers can break down complex food molecules to utilize the stored energy and use the particles to form new, life-sustaining molecules. Ecosystems are examples of how energy can flow while matter cycles through the living and nonliving components of systems.

*   **Standard 8.3.1** Plan and conduct an investigation and use the evidence to construct an explanation of how photosynthetic organisms use energy to transform matter. Emphasize molecular and energy transformations during photosynthesis. (PS3.D, LS1.C)

## Strand 8.4: INTERACTIONS WITH NATURAL SYSTEMS AND RESOURCES

Interactions of matter and energy through geologic processes have led to the uneven distribution of natural resources. Many of these resources are nonrenewable, and per-capita use can cause positive or negative consequences. Global temperatures change due to various factors, and can cause a change in regional climates. As energy flows through the physical world, natural disasters can occur that affect human life. Humans can study patterns in natural systems to anticipate and forecast some future disasters and work to mitigate the outcomes.

*   **Standard 8.4.1** Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence that shows that the uneven distribution of Earth’s mineral, energy, and groundwater resources is caused by geological processes. Examples of uneven distribution of resources could include Utah’s unique geologic history that led to the formation and irregular distribution of natural resources like copper, gold, natural gas, oil shale, silver, or uranium. (ESS3.A)
*   **Standard 8.4.2** Engage in argument supported by evidence about the effect of per-capita consumption of natural resources on Earth’s systems.

## INTRODUCTION

The biology SEEd standards explore the patterns, processes, relationships, and the environments of living organisms. Students analyze data on the role of matter cycles and energy flow when organisms interact with their environment to explain how the stability and change of an ecosystem and biodiversity can be affected. Students investigate the structures and functions of living organisms needed in order to support necessary life functions. Students explore the cause and effect relationships of heredity, the role of DNA in gene expression and protein synthesis, and how gene expression can be altered by environmental and genetic causes. Students investigate how the mechanisms of genetic variation can lead to diversity within and among species and explain how the unity among species as well as the great diversity of species is a result of evolution by natural selection. Additionally, students design and evaluate solutions to problems that exist in these areas.

## Strand BIO.2: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF LIFE

Living cells are composed of chemical elements and molecules that form macromolecules. The macromolecules in a cell function to carry out important reactions that allow cycling of matter and flow of energy within and between organisms. All organisms are made of one or more cells. The structure and function of a cell determines the cell’s role in an organism. Multicellular organisms have systems of tissues and organs that work together to meet the needs of the whole organism.

*   **Standard BIO.2.2** Ask questions to plan and carry out an investigation to determine how (a) the structure and function of cells, (b) the proportion and quantity of organelles, and (c) the shape of cells result in cells with specialized functions. Examples could include mitochondria in muscle and nerve cells, chloroplasts in leaf cells, ribosomes in pancreatic cells, or the shape of nerve cells and muscle cells. (LS1.A)
*   **Standard BIO.2.3** Develop and use a model to illustrate the cycling of matter and flow of energy through living things by the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Emphasize how the products of one reaction are the reactants of the other and how the energy transfers in these reactions. (PS3.D, LS1.C, LS2.B)

## Strand BIO.3: GENETIC PATTERNS

Heredity is a unifying biological principle that explains how information is passed from parent to offspring through deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules in the form of chromosomes. Distinct sequences of DNA, called genes, carry the code for specific proteins, which are responsible for the specific traits and life functions of organisms. There are predictable patterns of inheritance; however, changes in the DNA sequence and environmental factors may alter genetic expression. The variation and distribution of traits observed in a population depend on both genetic and environmental factors. Research in the field of heredity has led to the development of multiple genetic technologies that may improve the quality of life but may also raise ethical issues.

*   **Standard BIO.3.1** Construct an explanation for how the structure of DNA is replicated, and how DNA and RNA code for the structure of proteins which regulate and carry out the essential functions of life and result in specific traits. Emphasize a conceptual understanding that the sequence of nucleotides in DNA determines the amino acid sequence of proteins through the processes of transcription and translation. (LS1.A, LS3.A)
*   **Standard BIO.3.2** Use computational thinking and patterns to make predictions about the expression of specific traits that are passed in genes on chromosomes from parents to offspring. Emphasize that various inheritance patterns can be predicted by observing the way genes are expressed. Examples of tools to make predictions could include Punnett squares, pedigrees, or karyotypes. Examples of allele crosses could include dominant/recessive, incomplete dominant, codominant, or sex-linked alleles. (LS3.A)
*   **Standard BIO.3.3** Engage in argument from evidence that inheritable genetic variation is caused during the formation of gametes. Emphasize that genetic variation may be caused by epigenetics, during meiosis from new genetic combinations, or viable mutations. (LS3.B)
*   **Standard BIO.3.4** Plan and carry out an investigation and use computational thinking to explain the variation and patterns in distribution of the traits expressed in a population. Emphasize the distribution of traits as it relates to both genetic and environmental influences on the expression of those traits. Examples of variation and patterns in distribution of traits could include sickle-cell anemia and malaria, hemoglobin levels in humans at high elevation, or antibiotic resistance. (LS3.B)
*   **Standard BIO.3.5** Evaluate design solutions where biotechnology was used to identify and/or modify genes in order to solve (effect) a problem. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, analyze available data on proposed solutions, and determine an optimal solution. Emphasize arguments that focus on how effective the solution was at meeting the desired outcome. (LS3.B, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## Strand BIO.4: EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE

The unity among species, as evidenced in the fossil record, similarities in DNA and other biomolecules, anatomical structures, and embryonic development, is the result of evolution. Evolution also explains the diversity within and among species. Evolution by natural selection is the result of environmental factors selecting for and against genetic traits. Traits that allow an individual to survive and reproduce are likely to increase in the next generation, causing the proportions of specific traits to change within a population. Over longer periods of time, changes in proportions of traits due to natural selection and changes in selective pressures can cause both speciation and extinction. Changes in environmental conditions impact biodiversity in ecosystems affect the natural selection of species.

*   **Standard BIO.4.1** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information to identify the patterns in the evidence that support biological evolution. Examples of evidence could include DNA sequences, amino acid sequences, anatomical structures, the fossil record, or order of appearance of structures during embryological development. (LS4.A)
*   **Standard BIO.4.2** Construct an explanation based on evidence that natural selection is a primary cause of evolution. Emphasize that natural selection is primarily caused by the potential for a species to increase in number, the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, competition for limited resources, and the proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment. (LS2.D, LS4.B, LS4.C)
*   **Standard BIO.4.3** Analyze and interpret data to identify patterns that explain the claim that organisms with an advantageous heritable trait tend to increase in proportion to organisms lacking this trait. Emphasize analyzing shifts in the numerical distribution of traits and using these shifts as evidence to support explanations. (LS4.B, LS4.C)
*   **Standard BIO.4.4** Engage in argument from evidence that changes in environmental conditions may cause increases in the number of individuals of some species, the emergence of new species over time, and/or the extinction of other species. Emphasize the cause and effect relationships for how changes and the rate of change to the environment affect distribution or disappearance of traits in a species. Examples of changes in environmental conditions could include deforestation, application of fertilizers, drought, or flood. (LS4.C)
*   **Standard BIO.4.5** Evaluate design solutions that can best solve a real-world problem caused by natural selection and adaptation of populations. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, analyze available data on proposed solutions, and determine an optimal solution. Examples of real-world problems could include bacterial resistance to drugs, plant resistance to herbicides, or the effect of changes in climate on food sources and pollinators.

## INTRODUCTION

The chemistry SEEd standards explore the foundational principles of chemistry that allow students to investigate the ways in which chemistry impacts everyday life. Students investigate the properties and structure of matter at atomic and subatomic scales to explain how they influence a system’s larger scale, structures, properties, and functions. Students explain how macroscopic observations are translated into molecular-level representations and then develop and use these models to describe molecules with chemical equations or mathematical expressions. Students analyze data on the relationships between atomic and molecular structures and the properties of materials that are observed macroscopically using the human senses and scientific instruments. Students explain that matter is conserved in chemical reactions and nutrient cycles, the ability of humans to design and control chemical systems for the benefit of society, and the ways that energy interacts with matter. Additionally, students design and evaluate solutions to problems that exist in these areas.

## Strand CHEM.1: THE STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF ATOMS

Atoms have substructures of their own including a small central nucleus containing protons and neutrons surrounded by a larger region containing electrons. The strong nuclear interaction provides the primary force that holds nuclei together. Without it, the electromagnetic forces between protons would make all nuclei other than hydrogen unstable. Processes of fusion, fission, and radioactive decay of unstable nuclei involve changes in nuclear binding energies.

*   **Standard CHEM.1.4** Construct an explanation about how fusion can form new elements with greater or lesser nuclear stability. Emphasize the nuclear binding energy, with the conceptual understanding that when fusion of elements results in a more stable nucleus, large quantities of energy are released, and when fusion results in a less stable nucleus, large quantities of energy are required. Examples could include the building up of elements in the universe starting with hydrogen to form heavier elements, the composition of stars, or supernovae producing heavy elements. (PS1.C, ESS1.A)
*   **Standard CHEM.1.5** Use the periodic table as a model to predict the relative properties of elements based on the patterns of electrons in the outermost energy level of atoms. Emphasize conceptual understanding of trends and patterns. Examples could include trends in ionization energy, atomic radius, or electronegativity. Examples of properties for main group elements could include general reactivity, bonding type, or ion formation. (PS1.A)

## Strand CHEM.2: THE STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF MOLECULES

Electrical attractions and repulsions between charged particles (atomic nuclei and electrons) in matter explain the structure of atoms and the forces between atoms that cause them to form molecules via chemical bonds. Molecules can range in size from two atoms to thousands of atoms. The same forces cause atoms to combine to form extended structures, such as crystals or metals. The varied properties of the materials, both natural and manufactured, can be understood in terms of the atomic and molecular particles present and the forces within and between them. Materials are engineered to fulfill a desired function or role with desired properties.

*   **Standard CHEM.2.1** Analyze data to predict the type of bonding most likely to occur between two elements using the patterns of reactivity on the periodic table. Emphasize the types and strengths of attractions between charged particles in ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds. Examples could include the attraction between electrons on one atom and the nucleus of another atom in a covalent bond or between ions in an ionic compound. (PS1.A, PS2.B)
*   **Standard CHEM.2.2** Plan and carry out an investigation to compare the properties of substances at the bulk scale and relate them to molecular structures. Emphasize using models to explain or describe the strength of electrical forces between particles. Examples of models could include Lewis dot structures or ball and stick models. Examples of particles could include ions, atoms, molecules, or networked materials (such as graphite). Examples of properties could include melting point and boiling point, vapor pressure, solubility, or surface tension. (PS1.A)
*   **Standard CHEM.2.3** Engage in argument supported by evidence that the functions of natural and designed macromolecules are related to their chemical structures. Emphasize the roles of attractive forces between and within molecules. Examples could include non-covalent interactions between base pairs in DNA allowing it to be unzipped for replication, the network of atoms in a diamond conferring hardness, or the nonpolar nature of polyester (PET) making it quick-drying. (PS1.A)
*   **Standard CHEM.2.4** Evaluate design solutions where synthetic chemistry was used to solve a problem (cause and effect). Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, analyze available data on proposed solutions, and determine an optimal solution.

## Strand CHEM.3: STABILITY AND CHANGE IN CHEMICAL SYSTEMS

Conservation of matter describes the cycling of matter and the use of resources. In both chemical and physical changes, the total number of each type of atom is conserved. When substances are combined, they may interact with each other to form a solution. The proportion of substances in a solution can be represented with concentration. In a chemical change, the atoms are rearranged by breaking and forming bonds to create different molecules, which may have different properties. Chemical processes can be understood in terms of the collisions of molecules and the rearrangements of atoms. The rate at which chemical processes occur can be modified. In many situations, a dynamic and condition-dependent balance between a reaction and the reverse reaction determines the numbers of all types of molecules present. Chemists can control and design chemical systems to create desirable results, although sometimes there are also unintended consequences.

*   **Standard CHEM.3.1** Use mathematics and computational thinking to analyze the distribution and proportion of particles in solution. Emphasize proportional reasoning and the impact of concentration on solution properties, rather than algorithmic calculations. Examples of concentrations affecting solutions could include the Beer-Lambert Law, colligative properties, or pH. (PS1.A)
*   **Standard CHEM.3.2** Analyze data to identify patterns that assist in making predictions of the outcomes of simple chemical reactions. Emphasize patterns based on the outermost electrons of atoms, trends in the periodic table, and knowledge of chemical properties. Examples could include reactions between main group elements, combustion reactions, or reactions between Arrhenius acids and bases. (PS1.B)
*   **Standard CHEM.3.3** Plan and carry out an investigation to observe the change in properties of substances in a chemical reaction to relate the macroscopically observed properties to the molecular level changes in bonds and the symbolic notation used in chemistry. Emphasize that the visible macroscopic changes in chemical reactions are a result of changes on the molecular level. Examples of observable properties could include changes in color or the production of a solid or gaseous product. (PS1.B)
*   **Standard CHEM.3.4** Use mathematics and computational thinking to support the observation that matter is conserved during chemical reactions and matter cycles. Emphasize that chemical reactions occur on both small and global scales, and that matter is always conserved. Examples of small scale reactions could include ratios of reactants and products in a single chemical reaction or simple stoichiometric calculation. Examples of global scale matter cycles could include tracing carbon through the chemical reactions of photosynthesis, combustion, or respiration. (PS1.B)

*   **Standard CHEM.3.5** Develop solutions related to the management, conservation, and utilization of mineral resources (matter). Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, develop possible solutions using models, analyze data to make improvements from iteratively testing solutions, and optimize a solution. Emphasize the conservation of matter and minerals as a limited resource. Examples of Utah mineral resources could include copper, uranium, potash, coal, oil, or natural gas. Examples of constraints could include cost, safety, reliability, or possible social, cultural, and environmental impacts. (PS1.B, ESS3.A, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

*   **Standard CHEM.3.6** Construct an explanation using experimental evidence for how reaction conditions affect the rate of change of a reaction. Emphasize collision theory as an explanatory principle. Examples of reaction conditions could include temperature, concentration, particle size, or presence of a catalyst. (PS1.B)

*   **Standard CHEM.3.7** Design a solution that would refine a chemical system by specifying a change in conditions that would produce increased or decreased amounts of a product at equilibrium. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, develop possible solutions using models, analyze data to make improvements from iteratively testing solutions, and optimize a solution.

## Strand CHEM.4: ENERGY IN CHEMICAL SYSTEMS

A system’s total energy is conserved as energy is continually transferred from one particle to another and between its various possible forms. The energy of a system depends on the motion and interactions of matter and radiation within that system. When bonds are formed between atoms, energy is released. Energy must be provided when bonds are broken. When electromagnetic radiation with longer wavelengths is absorbed by matter, it is generally converted into thermal energy or heat. When visible light is absorbed by matter, it results in phenomena related to color. When shorter wavelength electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by matter, it can ionize atoms and cause damage to living cells. Nuclear processes, including fusion, fission, and radioactive decays of unstable nuclei, involve the release or absorption of large amounts of energy. Society’s demand for energy requires thinking creatively about ways to provide energy that don’t deplete limited resources or produce harmful emissions.

*   **Standard CHEM.4.1** Construct an argument from evidence about whether a simple chemical reaction absorbs or releases energy. Emphasize that the overall change in energy is related to the energy absorbed when bonds are broken and the energy released when bonds are formed. Examples could include chemical reactions releasing or absorbing energy to or from the surrounding solution or the metabolism of glucose. (PS1.B, PS3.B)
*   **Standard CHEM.4.2** Construct an explanation of the effects that different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation have when absorbed by matter. Emphasize a qualitative understanding. Examples could include that low energy electromagnetic radiation can increase molecular rotation and bond vibration, visible light can cause electronic transitions, and high energy electromagnetic radiation can result in ionization and bond breaking. (PS4.B)
*   **Standard CHEM.4.3** Design a device that converts energy from one form into another to solve a problem. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, develop possible solutions using models, analyze data to make improvements from iteratively testing solutions, and optimize a solution. Emphasize chemical potential energy as a type of stored energy. Examples of sources of chemical potential energy could include oxidation-reduction or combustion reactions. (PS3.B, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)
*   **Standard CHEM.4.4** Use models to describe the changes in the composition of the nucleus of the atom during nuclear processes, and compare the energy released during nuclear processes to the energy released during chemical processes. Emphasize a qualitative understanding of nuclear changes. Examples of nuclear processes could include the formation of elements through fusion in stars, generation of electricity in a nuclear power plant, radioactive decay, or the use of radioisotopes in nuclear medicine.

## Strand ESS.1: MATTER AND ENERGY IN SPACE

The Sun releases energy that eventually reaches Earth in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The Big Bang theory is supported by observations of distant galaxies receding from our own as well as other evidence. The study of stars' light spectra and brightness is used to identify compositional elements of stars, their movements, and their distances from Earth. Other than the hydrogen and helium formed at the time of the Big Bang, nuclear fusion within stars produces all atomic nuclei lighter than and including iron, releasing electromagnetic energy. Heavier elements are produced when certain massive stars reach a supernova stage and explode. New technologies advance science knowledge including space exploration.

*   **Standard ESS.1.1** Develop a model based on evidence to illustrate the life span of the Sun and the role of nuclear fusion releasing energy in the Sun's core. Emphasize energy transfer mechanisms that allow energy from nuclear fusion to reach Earth.

## Strand ESS.2: PATTERNS IN EARTH'S HISTORY AND PROCESSES

Although active geologic processes have destroyed or altered most of Earth's early rock record, evidence from within Earth and from other objects in the solar system are used to infer Earth's geologic history. Motions of the mantle and its plates occur primarily through thermal convection, which involves the cycling of matter due to the outward flow of energy from Earth's interior and gravitational movement of denser materials toward the interior. The radioactive decay of unstable isotopes continually generates new energy within Earth's crust and mantle, providing the primary source of the heat that drives mantle convection. Plate tectonics is the unifying theory that explains the past and current movements of the rocks at Earth's surface and provides a framework for understanding its geologic history and co-evolution of life.

*   **Standard ESS.2.1** Analyze and interpret data to construct an explanation for the changes in Earth's formation and 4.6 billion year history. Examples of data could include the absolute ages of ancient Earth materials, the size and composition of solar system objects like meteorites, or the impact cratering record of planetary surfaces. (ESS1.C)
*   **Standard ESS.2.2** Develop and use a model based on evidence of Earth's interior and describe the cycling of matter by thermal convection. Emphasize the density of Earth's layers and mantle convection driven by radioactive decay and heat from Earth's early formation. Examples of evidence could include maps of Earth's three-dimensional structure obtained from seismic waves or records of the rate of change of Earth's magnetic field. (PS1.C, ESS2.A, ESS2.B)
*   **Standard ESS.2.3** Construct an explanation for how plate tectonics results in patterns on Earth's surface. Emphasize past and current plate motions. Examples could include continental and ocean floor features such as mountain ranges and mid-ocean ridges, magnetic polarity preserved in seafloor rocks, or regional hot spots. (ESS2.B)
*   **Standard ESS.2.4** Develop and use a model to illustrate how Earth's internal and surface processes operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Emphasize how the appearance of land and seafloor features are a result of both constructive forces and destructive mechanisms. Examples of constructive forces could include tectonic uplift or mountain building. Examples of destructive mechanisms could include weathering or mass wasting. (ESS2.B)

*   **Standard ESS.2.5** Engage in argument from evidence for how the simultaneous co-evolution of Earth's systems and life on Earth led to periods of stability and change over geologic time. Examples could include how microbial life on land increased the formation of soil, which in turn allowed for the evolution of land plants or how the evolution of corals created reefs that altered patterns of coastal erosion and deposition providing habitats for the evolution of new life forms. (LS4.D, ESS2.D, ESS2.E)

## Strand ESS.3: SYSTEM INTERACTIONS: ATMOSPHERE, HYDROSPHERE, AND GEOSPHERE

The abundance of liquid water on Earth’s surface and its unique properties are central to the planet’s dynamics and system interactions. The foundation for Earth’s global weather and climate systems is electromagnetic radiation from the Sun. The ocean exerts a major influence on weather and climate by absorbing energy from the Sun, releasing it over time, and globally redistributing it through ocean currents. Changes in the atmosphere due to human activity increase carbon dioxide concentrations and thus affect climate. Current scientific models predict that future average global temperatures will continue to rise, although regional climate changes will be complex and varied.

*   **Standard ESS.3.1** Plan and carry out an investigation of the properties of water and its effects on Earth materials and surface processes. Examples of properties could include water’s capacity to expand upon freezing, dissolve and transport material, or absorb, store, and release energy. (ESS2.C)
*   **Standard ESS.3.2** Construct an explanation of how heat (energy) and water (matter) move throughout the oceans causing patterns in weather and climate. Emphasize the mechanisms for surface and deep ocean movement. Examples of mechanisms for surface movement could include wind, Sun’s energy, or the Coriolis effect. Examples of mechanisms for deep ocean movement could include water density differences due to temperature or salinity. (ESS2.C, ESS2.D)
*   **Standard ESS.3.3** Construct an explanation for how energy from the Sun drives atmospheric processes and how atmospheric currents transport matter and transfer energy. Emphasize how energy from the Sun is reflected, absorbed, or scattered; how the greenhouse effect contributes to atmospheric energy; and how uneven heating of Earth’s atmosphere combined with the Coriolis effect creates an atmospheric circulation system. (PS3.A, ESS1.B, ESS2.A, ESS2.D)
*   **Standard ESS.3.4** Analyze and interpret patterns in data about the factors influencing weather of a given location.

Emphasize each of Earth's systems (hydrosphere, atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere) and how the movement of carbon from one system to another can result in changes to the system(s). Examples could include more carbon absorbed in the oceans leading to ocean acidification or more carbon present in the atmosphere leading to a stronger greenhouse effect. (LS2.B, ESS2.D, ESS3.D)

*   **Standard ESS.3.6** Analyze and interpret data from global climate records to illustrate changes to Earth's systems throughout geologic time and make predictions about future variations using modern trends.

## Strand ESS.4: STABILITY AND CHANGE IN NATURAL RESOURCES

Humans depend on Earth’s systems for many different resources, including air, water, minerals, metals, and energy. Resource availability has guided the development of human society and is constantly changing due to societal needs. Natural hazards and other geologic events have shaped the course of human history. The sustainability of human societies, and the biodiversity that supports them, requires responsible management of natural resources. Scientists and engineers can make major contributions by developing technologies that produce less pollution and waste and that reduce ecosystem degradation. They also evaluate solutions to resolve complex global and localized problems that contain inherent social, cultural, and environmental impacts in an effort to improve the quality of life for all.

*   **Standard ESS.4.1** Construct an explanation for how the availability of natural resources, the occurrence of natural hazards, and changes in climate affect human activity. Examples of natural resources could include access to fresh water, clean air, or regions of fertile soils. Examples of factors that affect human activity could include that rising sea levels cause humans to move farther from the coast or that humans build railroads to transport mineral resources from one location to another. (ESS3.A, ESS3.B)

*   **Standard ESS.4.2** Use computational thinking to explain the relationships between the sustainability of natural resources and biodiversity within Earth systems. Emphasize the importance of responsible stewardship of Earth’s resources.

Examples of large-scale solutions could include developing best practices for agricultural soil use or mining and production of conventional, unconventional, or renewable energy resources. Examples of small-scale solutions could include mulching lawn clippings or adding biomass to gardens. (ESS3.A, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

*   **Standard ESS.4.4** Evaluate design solutions for a major global or local environmental problem based on one of Earth’s systems. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, analyze available data on proposed solutions, and determine an optimal solution. Examples of major global or local problems could include water pollution or availability, air pollution, deforestation, or energy production. (ESS3.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## INTRODUCTION

The physics SEEd standards explore the foundational principles of physics including forces, energy, fields, and waves. Students analyze and interpret data to determine the cause and effect relationship between the net force of an object and its change in motion. Students develop and use models to illustrate that energy at all levels can be accounted for as a combination of energies associated with motion and relative positions of objects. Students use mathematics and computational thinking to support the claim that the total momentum of a system is conserved when there is no net force acting on a system. Students plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that an electric current causes a magnetic field and that a changing magnetic field causes an electric current. Students also engage in argument to support the assertion that electromagnetic radiation can be described either by a wave or a particle model. Additionally, students design and evaluate solutions to problems that exist in these areas.

## Strand PHYS.1: FORCES AND INTERACTIONS

Uniform motion of an object is natural. Changes in motion are caused by a nonzero sum of forces. A "net force" causes an acceleration as predicted by Newton's 2nd Law. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of position, velocity, and acceleration provide evidence of the effects of forces. Momentum is defined for a particular frame of reference; it is the product of the mass and the velocity of the object. In any system, total momentum is always conserved. If a system interacts with objects outside itself, the total momentum of the system can change; however, any such change is balanced by changes in the momentum of objects outside the system. The time over which these paired forces are exerted determines the impact force.

*   **Standard PHYS.1.1** Analyze and interpret data to determine the cause and effect relationship between the net force on an object and its change in motion as summarized by Newton's Second Law of Motion. Emphasize one-dimensional motion and macroscopic objects moving at non-relativistic speeds. Examples could include objects subject to a net unbalanced force, such as a falling object, an object sliding down a ramp, or a moving object being pulled by a constant force. (PS2.A)
*   **Standard PHYS.1.2** Use mathematics and computational thinking to support the claim that the total momentum of a system is conserved when there is no net force acting on the system. Emphasize the quantitative conservation of momentum in interactions and the qualitative meaning of this principle. Examples could include one-dimensional elastic or inelastic collisions between objects within the system. (PS2.A)
*   **Standard PHYS.1.3** Design a solution that has the function of minimizing the impact force on an object during a collision. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, develop possible solutions using models, analyze data to make improvements from iteratively testing solutions, and optimize a solution. Emphasize problems that require application of Newton's Second Law of Motion or conservation of momentum. (PS2.A, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

## Strand PHYS.2: ENERGY

Energy describes the motion and interactions of matter and radiation within a system. Energy is a quantifiable property that is conserved in isolated systems and in the universe as a whole. At the macroscopic scale, energy manifests itself in multiple ways such as in motion, sound, light, and thermal energy. Uncontrolled systems always evolve toward more stable states—that is, toward more uniform energy distribution. Examining the world through an energy lens allows us to model and predict complex interactions of multiple objects within a system and address societal needs.

*   **Standard PHYS.2.1** Analyze and interpret data to track and calculate the transfer of energy within a system. Emphasize the identification of the components of the system, along with their initial and final energies, and mathematical descriptions to depict energy transfer in the system. Examples of energy transfer could include the transfer of energy during a collision or heat transfer. (PS3.A, PS3.B)
*   **Standard PHYS.2.2** Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that the transfer of thermal energy when two components of different temperature are combined within a closed system results in a more uniform energy distribution among the components in the system. Emphasize that uniform distribution of energy is a natural tendency. Examples could include the measurement of the reduction of temperature of a hot object or the increase in temperature of a cold object. (PS3.B)
*   **Standard PHYS.2.3** Develop and use models on the macroscopic scale to illustrate that energy can be accounted for as a combination of energies associated with the motion of objects and energy associated with the relative positions of objects. Emphasize relationships between components of the model to show that energy is conserved. Examples could include mechanical systems where kinetic energy is transformed to potential energy or vice versa. (PS3.A)
*   **Standard PHYS.2.4** Design a solution by constructing a device that converts one form of energy into another form of energy to solve a complex real-life problem. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, develop possible solutions using models, analyze data to make improvements from iteratively testing solutions, and optimize a solution. Examples of energy transformation could include electrical energy to mechanical energy, mechanical energy to electrical energy, or electromagnetic radiation to thermal energy. (PS3.A, PS3.B, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

- **Standard PHYS 2.5** Design a solution to a major global problem that accounts for societal energy needs and wants. Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, develop possible solutions using models, analyze data to make improvements from iteratively testing solutions, and optimize a solution. Emphasize problems that require the application of conservation of energy principles through energy transfers and transformations. Examples of devices could include one that uses renewable energy resources to perform functions currently performed by nonrenewable fuels or ones that are more energy efficient to conserve energy.

## Strand PHYS.3: FIELDS

Fields describe how forces act through space and how potential energy is stored in systems. These take on different forms of electric, magnetic, or gravitational fields, but similarly provide a mechanism for how matter interacts. When two objects interacting through a field change relative position, the energy stored in the field is changed. These fields are important at a wide variety of scales, ranging from the subatomic to the astronomic.

*   **Standard PHYS.3.1** Use mathematics and computational thinking to compare the scale and proportion of gravitational and electric fields using Newton’s Law of Gravitation and Coulomb’s Law. Emphasize the comparative strength of these two field forces, the effect of distance between interacting objects on the magnitudes of these forces, and the use of models to understand field forces. (PS2.B)
*   **Standard PHYS.3.2** Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that an electric current causes a magnetic field and that a changing magnetic field causes an electric current. Emphasize the qualitative relationship between electricity and magnetism without necessarily conducting quantitative analysis. Examples could include electromagnets or generators. (PS2.C)
*   **Standard PHYS.3.3** Analyze and interpret data to compare the effect of changes in position of interacting objects on electric and gravitational forces and energy. Emphasize the similarities and differences between charged particles in electric fields and masses in gravitational fields. Examples could include models, simulations, or experiments that produce data or illustrate field lines between objects. (PS3.C)
*   **Standard PHYS.3.4** Develop and use a model to evaluate the effects on a field as characteristics of its source and surrounding space are varied. Emphasize how a field changes with distance from its source. Examples of electric fields could include those resulting from point charges. Examples of magnetic fields could include those resulting from dipole magnets or current-bearing wires. (PS3.C)

# UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS

## Strand PHYS.4: WAVES

Waves transfer energy through oscillations of fields or matter. The wavelength and frequency of a wave are related to one another by the speed of travel of the wave, which depends on the type of wave and the medium through which it passes. Waves produce interference as they overlap but they emerge unaffected by each other. The wave model is useful for explaining many features of electromagnetic radiation, and the particle model explains other features. Electromagnetic radiation can be modeled as a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields or as particles called photons. When light or longer wavelength electromagnetic radiation is absorbed in matter, it is generally converted into thermal energy. Because waves depend upon the properties of fields and the predictable transformation of energy, they can be used to interpret the nature of matter and its energy. Waves are utilized to transmit information both in analog and digital forms.

*   **Standard PHYS.4.1** Analyze and interpret data to derive both qualitative and quantitative relationships based on patterns observed in frequency, wavelength, and speed of waves traveling in various media. Emphasize mathematical relationships and qualitative descriptions. Examples of data could include electromagnetic radiation traveling in a vacuum or glass, sound waves traveling through air or water, or seismic waves traveling through Earth. (PS4.A)
*   **Standard PHYS.4.2** Engage in argument based on evidence that electromagnetic radiation can be described either by a wave model or a particle model, and that for some situations one model better explains interactions within a system than the other. Emphasize how the experimental evidence supports the claim and how models and explanations are modified in light of new evidence. Examples could include resonance, interference, diffraction, or the photoelectric effect. (PS4.A, PS4.B)
*   **Standard PHYS.4.3** Evaluate information about the effects that different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation have when absorbed by biological materials. Emphasize that the energy of electromagnetic radiation is directly proportional to frequency and that the potential damage to living tissue from electromagnetic radiation depends on the energy of the radiation. (PS4.B)
*   **Standard PHYS.4.4** Ask questions and construct an explanation about the stability of digital transmission and storage of information and their impacts on society. Emphasize the stability of digital signals and the discrete nature of information transmission. Examples of stability and instability could include that digital information can be stored in computer memory, is transferred easily, copied and shared rapidly can be easily deleted, has limited fidelity based on sampling rates, or is vulnerable to security breaches and theft. (PS4.A)

- **Standard PHYS.4.5** Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about how devices use the principles of electromagnetic radiation and their interactions with matter to transmit and capture information and energy. Emphasize the ways in which devices leverage the wave-particle duality of electromagnetic radiation. Examples could include solar cells, medical imaging devices, or communication technologies.

# INTRODUCTION

## UTAH HIGH SCHOOL SUPPLEMENTAL SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION STANDARDS

Utah’s High School Supplemental Science and Engineering Education (SEEd) standards were written with support from Utah educators and scientists, using a wide array of resources and expertise. A great deal is known about good science instruction. The writing team used sources including *A Framework for K–12 Science Education*¹, the *Science Georgia Standards of Excellence (GSE)*², and related works to craft research-based standards for Utah. These standards were written with high school students in mind to provide them with developmentally appropriate learning that extends from the Utah foundation SEEd Standards in Biology, Chemistry, Earth and Space Science, and Physics. These courses are intended to foster learning that is age-appropriate and enduring with the aim of addressing what an educated citizenry should know and understand to embrace the value of scientific thinking and make informed decisions. All Utah SEEd standards are founded on what science is, how science is learned, and the multiple dimensions of scientific work.

As these high school science supplemental courses are taught in both semester and yearlong formats, the standards were written to be able to be taught in a semester. Educators teaching these as yearlong courses will be able to expand them to meet the needs of their students. Teaching these courses as a semester or yearlong format is a local school or district decision.

### Principles of Scientific Literacy

Science is a way of knowing, a process for understanding the natural world. Engineering applies the fields of science, technology, and mathematics to produce solutions to real-world problems. The process of developing scientific knowledge includes ongoing questioning, testing, and refinement of ideas when supported by empirical evidence. Since progress in modern society is tied so closely to this way of knowing, scientific literacy is essential for a society to be engaged in political and economic choices on personal, local, regional, and global scales. As such, the Utah SEEd standards are based on the following essential elements of scientific literacy.

**Science is valuable, relevant, and applicable.**
Science produces knowledge that is inherently important to our society and culture. Science and engineering support innovation and enhance the lives of individuals and society. Science is supported from and benefited by an equitable and democratic culture. Science is for all people, at all levels of education, and from all backgrounds.

**Science is a shared way of knowing and doing.**
Science learning experiences should celebrate curiosity, wonder, skepticism, precision,

&lt;page_number&gt;INTRODUCTION | 95&lt;/page_number&gt;

## Page 96

# UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS

and accuracy. Scientific habits of mind include questioning, communicating, reasoning, analyzing, collaborating, and thinking critically. These values are shared within and across scientific disciplines, and should be embraced by students, teachers, and society at large.

## Science is principled and enduring.
Scientific knowledge is constructed from empirical evidence; therefore, it is both changeable and durable. Science is based on observations and inferences, an understanding of scientific laws and theories, use of scientific methods, creativity, and collaboration. The Utah SEEd standards are based on current scientific theories, which are powerful and broad explanations of a wide range of phenomena; they are not simply guesses nor are they unchangeable facts.

Science is principled in that it is limited to observable evidence. Science is also enduring in that theories are only accepted when they are robustly supported by multiple lines of peer reviewed evidence. The history of science demonstrates how scientific knowledge can change and progress, and it is rooted in the cultures from which it emerged. Scientists, engineers, and society, are responsible for developing scientific understandings with integrity, supporting claims with existing and new evidence, interpreting competing explanations of phenomena, changing models purposefully, and finding applications that are ethical.

## Principles of Science Learning
Just as science is an active endeavor, students best learn science by engaging in it. This includes gathering information through observations, reasoning, and communicating with others. It is not enough for students to read about or watch science from a distance; learners must become active participants in forming their ideas and engaging in scientific practice. The Utah SEEd standards are based on several core philosophical and research-based underpinnings of science learning.

## Science learning is personal and engaging.
Research in science education supports the assertion that students at all levels learn most when they are able to construct and reflect upon their ideas, both by themselves and in collaboration with others. Learning is not merely an act of retaining information but creating ideas informed by evidence and linked to previous ideas and experiences. Therefore, the most productive learning settings engage students in authentic experiences with natural phenomena or problems to be solved. Learners develop tools for understanding as they look for patterns, develop explanations, and communicate with others. Science education is most effective when learners invest in their own sense-making and their learning context provides an opportunity to engage with real-world problems.

## Science learning is multi-purposed.
Science learning serves many purposes. We learn science because it brings us joy and appreciation but also because it solves problems, expands understanding, and informs

<footer>INTRODUCTION | 96</footer>

# UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS

society. It allows us to make predictions, improve our world, and mitigate challenges. An understanding of science and how it works is necessary in order to participate in a democratic society. So, not only is science a tool to be used by the future engineer or lab scientist but also by every citizen, every artist, and every other human who shares an appreciation for the world in which we live.

**All students are capable of science learning.**
Science learning is a right of all individuals and must be accessible to all students in equitable ways. Independent of grade level, geography, gender, economic status, cultural background, or any other demographic descriptor, all K–12 students are capable of science learning and science literacy. Science learning is most equitable when students have agency and can engage in practices of science and sense-making for themselves, under the guidance and mentoring of an effective teacher and within an environment that puts student experience at the center of instruction. Moreover, all students are capable learners of science, and all grades and classes should provide authentic, developmentally appropriate science instruction.

## Three Dimensions of Science

Science is composed of multiple types of knowledge and tools. These include the processes of doing science, the structures that help us organize and connect our understandings, and the deep explanatory pieces of knowledge that provide predictive power. These facets of science are represented as “three dimensions” of science learning, and together these help us to make sense of all that science does and represents. These include science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas. Taken together, these represent how we use science to make sense of phenomena, and they are most meaningful when learned in concert with one another. These are described in *A Framework for K–12 Science Education*, referenced above, and briefly described here:

**Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs):** Practices refer to the things that scientists and engineers do and how they actively engage in their work. Scientists do much more than make hypotheses and test them with experiments. They engage in wonder, design, modeling, construction, communication, and collaboration. The practices describe the variety of activities that are necessary to do science, and they also imply how scientific thinking is related to thinking in other subjects, including math, writing, and the arts. For a further understanding of science and engineering practices see Chapter 3 in *A Framework for K–12 Science Education*.

**Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs):** Crosscutting concepts are the organizing structures that provide a framework for assembling pieces of scientific knowledge. They reach across disciplines and demonstrate how specific ideas are united into overarching principles. For example, a mechanical engineer might design some process that transfers energy from a fuel source into a moving part, while a biologist might study how predators and prey are interrelated. Both of these would need to model systems of energy to understand how all of the features interact, even though they are studying different subjects. Understanding crosscutting concepts enables us to

<footer>INTRODUCTION | &lt;page_number&gt;97&lt;/page_number&gt;</footer>

---


## Page 98

# UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS

make connections among different subjects and to utilize science in diverse settings. Additional information on crosscutting concepts can be found in Chapter 4 of *A Framework for K–12 Science Education*.

**Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs):** Core ideas within the foundation High School SEEd Standards for Biology, Chemistry, Earth and Space Science, and Physics include those most fundamental and explanatory pieces of knowledge in a discipline. They are often what we traditionally associate with science knowledge and specific subject areas within science. Seeing as how the High School Supplemental Standards are an extension of the foundation High School courses, the content in these standards move beyond those identified as Disciplinary Core Ideas in Chapters 5 through 7 of *A Framework for K–12 Science Education*. The standards within this document with a specific focus on engineering are closely aligned to the Core Ideas found in Chapter 8 of the *K–12 Framework for K–12 Science Education*. For this reason, the Disciplinary Core Idea Codes (listed in parentheses after each standard in the foundation High School SEEd Standards) will not be included in these standards.

# UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS

## Organization of Standards

The Utah SEEd standards are organized into **strands** which represent significant areas of learning within grade level progressions and content areas. Each strand introduction is an orientation for the teacher in order to provide an overall view of the concepts needed for foundational understanding. These include descriptions of how the standards tie together thematically and science content is used to unite that theme. Within each strand are **standards**. A standard is an articulation of how a learner may demonstrate their proficiency, incorporating not science content but also a crosscutting concept and a science and engineering practice. While a standard represents an essential element of what is expected, it does not dictate curriculum—it only represents a proficiency level for that grade. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for a comprehensive understanding of a strand’s purpose.

The standards of any given grade or course are not independent. SEEd standards are written with developmental levels and learning progressions in mind so that many topics are built upon from one grade to another. In addition, SEPs and CCCs are especially well paralleled with other disciplines, including English language arts, fine arts, mathematics, and social sciences. Therefore, SEEd standards should be considered to exist not as an island unto themselves, but as a part of an integrated, comprehensive, and holistic educational experience.

Each standard is framed upon the three dimensions of science to represent a cohesive, multi-faceted science learning outcome.

*   Within each SEEd Standard Science and Engineering Practices are bolded.
*   Crosscutting Concepts are underlined.
*   Science content including and extending from the Disciplinary Core Ideas are added to the standard in normal font. The Disciplinary Core Idea Codes (listed in parentheses after each standard in the foundation High School SEEd Standards) are not included in these standards.
*   Standards with *specific engineering expectations* are italicized.
*   Many standards contain additional emphasis and example statements that clarify the learning goals for students.
    *   Emphasis statements highlight a required and necessary part of the student learning to satisfy that standard.
    *   Example statements help to clarify the meaning of the standard and are not required for instruction.

# ASTRONOMY

## INTRODUCTION

The Astronomy High School Supplemental SEEd Standards explore the patterns, forces, relationships, and systems of matter and energy found in the Universe. Students develop models and investigate patterns observed on Earth and in the night sky of phenomena that affect life on Earth.

# K-12 PROGRESSIONS

Research from *A Framework for K–12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas* (NRC, 2012), the foundational document from which the Utah SEEd Standards were developed, “emphasizes developing students’ proficiency in science in a coherent way across grades K–12 following the logic of learning progressions” (p. 33). This document emphasizes that learning progressions are necessary for all three dimensions delineated in the report: Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs), Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs), and Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs).

As a support for educators, The National Science Teaching Association (NSTA) has provided general learning progressions in a matrix format that adhere to the outlined learning progression endpoints described in the *Framework* (NRC, 2012) document. These Matrices visually display a coherent progression of the SEPs, CCCs, and DCIs through the K–2, 3–5, 6–8, and 9–12 grade bands.

The SEP, CCC, and DCI learning progressions for each Utah SEEd Standards are specifically delineated within the [grade-level Core Guides](grade-level Core Guides). They were developed by teams of Utah Educators with the USBE education specialists to serve as a resource for Utah teachers as they consider classroom instruction aligned to the standards. The DCI progressions for the K–12 Utah SEEd Standards can be found in this document: [K–12 SEEd DCI Science Concept Progressions](K–12 SEEd DCI Science Concept Progressions).

This document provides the more general SEP and CCC learning progressions developed by NSTA and adapted within the Utah Science Core Guides. The learning progressions of the SEPs and CCCs for each Utah SEEd Standard are slightly different from the generic model to account for how the three dimensions work together in a specific context. The following SEP matrices are color-coded in Blue, and the CCC matrices are color-coded in green.

## Asking Questions and Defining Problems

A practice of science is to ask and refine questions that lead to descriptions and explanations of how the natural and designed world works and which can be empirically tested. Engineering questions clarify problems to determine criteria for successful solutions and identify constraints to solve problems about the designed world. Both scientists and engineers also ask questions to clarify ideas.

## Developing and Using Models

A practice of both science and engineering is to use and construct models as helpful tools for representing ideas and explanations. These tools include diagrams, drawings, physical replicas, mathematical representations, analogies, and computer simulations. Modeling tools are used to develop questions, predictions, and explanations; analyze and identify flaws in systems; and communicate ideas. Models are used to build and revise scientific explanations and proposed engineered systems. Measurements and observations are used to revise models and designs.

## Planning and Carrying Out Investigations

Scientists and engineers plan and carry out investigations in the field or laboratory, working collaboratively as well as individually. Their investigations are systematic and require clarifying what counts as data and identifying variables or parameters.

## Analyzing and Interpreting Data

Scientific investigations produce data that must be analyzed to derive meaning. Because data patterns and trends are not always obvious, scientists use a range of tools—including tabulation, graphical interpretation, visualization, and statistical analysis—to identify the significant features and patterns in the data. Scientists identify sources of error in the investigations and calculate the degree of certainty in the results. Modern technology ►►

▶▶ makes the collection of large data sets much easier, providing secondary sources for analysis. Engineering investigations include analysis of data collected in the tests of designs. This allows comparison of different solutions and determines how well each meets specific design criteria—that is, which design best solves the problem within given constraints. Like scientists, engineers require a range of tools to identify patterns within data and interpret the results. Advances in science make analysis of proposed solutions more efficient and effective.

## Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking

In both science and engineering, mathematics and computation are fundamental tools for representing physical variables and their relationships. They are used for a range of tasks such as constructing simulations; solving equations exactly or approximately; and recognizing, expressing, and applying quantitative relationships. Mathematical and computational approaches enable scientists and engineers to predict the behavior of systems and test the validity of such predictions.

## Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions

The end-products of science are explanations and the end-products of engineering are solutions. The goal of science is the construction of theories that provide explanatory accounts of the world. A theory becomes accepted when it has multiple lines of empirical evidence and greater explanatory power of phenomena than previous theories. The goal of engineering design is to find a systematic solution to problems that is based on scientific knowledge and models of the material world. Each proposed solution results from a process of balancing competing criteria of desired functions, technical feasibility, cost, safety, aesthetics, and compliance with legal requirements. The optimal choice depends on how well the proposed solutions meet criteria and constraints.

## Engaging in Argument from Evidence

Argumentation is the process by which evidence-based conclusions and solutions are reached. In science and engineering, reasoning and argument based on evidence are essential to identifying the best explanation for a natural phenomenon or the best solution to a design problem. Scientists and engineers use argumentation to listen to, compare, and evaluate competing ideas and methods based on merits. Scientists and engineers engage in argumentation when investigating a phenomenon, testing a design solution, resolving questions about measurements, building data models, and using evidence to evaluate claims.

## Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information

Scientists and engineers must be able to communicate clearly and persuasively the ideas and methods they generate. Critiquing and communicating ideas individually and in groups is a critical professional activity. Communicating information and ideas can be done in multiple ways: using tables, diagrams, graphs, models, and equations as well as orally, in writing, and through extended discussions. Scientists and engineers employ multiple sources to obtain information that is used to evaluate the merit and validity of claims, methods, and designs.

      <td>Natural objects and/or observable phenomena exist from the very small to the immensely large or from very short to very long time periods. Standard units are used to measure and describe physical quantities such as weight, time, temperature, and volume.</td>
      <td>Time, space, and energy phenomena can be observed at various scales using models to study systems that are too large or too small. The observed function of natural and designed systems may change with scale. Proportional relationships (e.g., speed as the ratio of distance traveled to time taken) among different types of quantities provide information about the magnitude of properties and processes. Scientific relationships can be represented through the use of algebraic expressions and equations. Phenomena that can be observed at one scale may not be observable at another scale.</td>
      <td>The significance of a phenomenon is dependent on the scale, proportion, and quantity at which it occurs. Some systems can only be studied indirectly because they are too small, too large, too fast, or too slow to observe directly. Patterns observable at one scale may not be observable or exist at other scales. Using the concept of orders of magnitude allows one to understand how a model at one scale relates to a model at another scale. Algebraic thinking is used to examine scientific data and predict the effect of a change in one variable on another (e.g., linear growth vs. exponential growth).</td>
