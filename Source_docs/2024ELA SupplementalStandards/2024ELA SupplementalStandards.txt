Students must set aside personal bias and previous knowledge to objectively debate various sides of an issue and understand the complexities of the world in order to develop solutions that are workable and solve inherent problems. These skills are invaluable for college, career, and citizenship. These standards were created knowing that Utah LEAs and schools structure their speech and debate courses differently based on individual needs and demands. Therefore, some of the standards may not be applicable to all speech/debate courses but should be used as guides. For example, some schools may have a speech/debate course that is not a competition class, while others may. Additionally, some schools may offer Speech/Debate I, II, and/or III, and thus, they may divide these standards across the various courses. Competition policies and guidelines are dictated by Utah High School Activities Association (UHSAA) and the Utah Debate Coaches Association (UDCA). Speech and Debate courses are applied or advanced courses that may be used to fulfill up to one credit of the English Language Arts graduation requirement.

These benefits are in addition to the development of critical thinking, interpersonal communication, and personal edification and fulfillment.\n\nThese standards were created knowing that not all LEAs and schools have a literary magazine or publication. Therefore, Strand 5 may not be applicable to all creative writing courses. Students may find writing opportunities for their work through writing groups, publications, scholarships, contests, or workshops. Additionally, examples in the standards are not meant to be viewed as an exhaustive checklist of items to teach but rather help to better define the standard.\n\nHigh school Creative Writing and Literary Magazine courses are applied or advanced courses that may be used to fulfill up to one credit of the English Language Arts graduation requirement.
