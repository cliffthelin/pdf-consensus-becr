# APPENDIX A: GLOSSARY OF JOURNALISM TERMS

## Types of Journalism Pieces/Medium:

**Column**
Columns provide observations, experiences, reporting and opinions from a personal perspective. They should elicit emotion of some sort and may be humorous, sad, ironic, angry or express other emotions that are appropriate for the subject matter. Columns include personal essays, which build from a personal experience to make a broader point and should have some type of reported, verified facts behind them.

**Copywriting**
The art of creating written content that accompanies an advertising campaign. Advertising copywriting is based on the idea of marketing a particular product to a specific consumer audience.

**Enterprise story**
Enterprise stories are news stories that take a deeper look into the topic. They require numbers that establish the trend or support the narrative and multiple sources, including someone who is living the problem or trend and experts who can bring perspective to the problem or trend.

**Features**
Human-interest stories that may make readers laugh or cry, love or hate, envy or pity, such as a profile of a person, a “how to,” article, hobbies or other “soft news.” (Bender, et al., 2019). These also have the element of objectivity and written in the third person.

**Opinion**
Opinion articles are written with the aim to persuade. They may be written in the first, second or third person. They may express the opinion of a single person or an institution, such as an editorial board. An opinion article that expresses the opinion of the news organization’s editorial board is an editorial. They should be based on facts that are attributed and verified.

**News**
Serious or timely stories about important topics that inform or educate (Bender, et al., 2019). A key element is objectivity, written in the third person.

**Podcast**
a digital audio file made available on the internet for downloading to a computer or mobile device, typically available as a series, new installments of which can be received by subscribers automatically that include interviews with newsworthy or entertaining people highlighted with audio production techniques such as natural sound, music, sound effects and good editing.

**Reviews**
Critical essays on the performance of some type of art: visual, performing or written.

&lt;page_number&gt;6&lt;/page_number&gt;

## Page 9

JOURNALISM Supplemental Standards for English Language Arts

**Types of Standard Journalism Conventions:**

**Lead or lede**
The first paragraph of a news story. Usually this includes a summary of the main point and covers the 5 W's: who, what, when, where, why and how. However, other types of ledes are possible, such feature ledes, anecdotal ledes that tell a little story and other creative ledes.

**Nut graph**
When feature ledes are used, a nut graph should follow to summarize the importance of the story and any of the 5 W's that were not covered in the lede.

**Attribution**
A journalistic way of citing sources. It consists primarily of “So-and-so said.” or “according to Source.”

**Inverted pyramid**
A way of organizing a journalistic story that highlights importance over chronology.

**Other ways of organizing journalistic stories**
There are multiple ways of organizing a journalistic story other than the inverted pyramid. The inverted pyramid is a starting place for beginning journalists.

**VO-SOT-VO**
Short for voiceover / sound on tape / voiceover, this is a broadcast journalism convention that has an announcer reading the news over recorded video, also known as b-roll, with a quote from an interviewee (SOT) in the middle. They often last from 30 to 60 seconds.

**Package**
In broadcast journalism, this is a more fully reported story with the reporter appearing on camera to talk directly to the audience, as well as doing voiceovers and including SOTs. The package tells a more in-depth story and usually will last from 2 to 5 minutes.

**AP Style**
Associated Press style is the standard guide to form and content in journalism. It covers topics from grammar, punctuation and capitalization to inclusive language and polling.

SPEECH & DEBATE Supplemental Standards for English Language Arts

# SPEECH & DEBATE

## INTRODUCTION

Speech and Debate provides students an opportunity to develop skills in research, critical thinking, organization, persuasion and communication. Students must set aside personal bias and previous knowledge to objectively debate various sides of an issue and understand the complexities of the world in order to develop solutions that are workable and solve inherent problems. These skills are invaluable for college, career, and citizenship.

These standards were created knowing that Utah LEAs and schools structure their speech and debate courses differently based on individual needs and demands. Therefore, some of the standards may not be applicable to all speech/debate courses but should be used as guides. For example, some schools may have a speech/debate course that is not a competition class, while others may. Additionally, some schools may offer Speech/Debate I, II, and/or III, and thus, they may divide these standards across the various courses. Competition policies and guidelines are dictated by Utah High School Activities Association (UHSAA) and the Utah Debate Coaches Association (UDCA).

Speech and Debate courses are applied or advanced courses that may be used to fulfill up to one credit of the English Language Arts graduation requirement. These standards align with the Utah Core Standards for English Language Arts.

**Strand 1: Research and Development.** Students will read and collect research from textual evidence to prepare for debates.

*   **Standard 1.1:** Prepare for and present in a variety of speech and debate formats (see appendix).
*   **Standard 1.2:** Analyze current events and political atmosphere (e.g., domestic policy, economic policy, foreign policy, social climate).
*   **Standard 1.3:** Collaborate to define issues and develop strategies.
*   **Standard 1.4:** Research arguments to support substantive claims using a variety of primary and/or secondary sources including but not limited to historical, scientific, and technical texts:
    *   central idea
    *   discrepancies in content
    *   explanation for action or events
    *   points of view
    *   specialized vocabulary
    *   textual evidence
*   **Standard 1.5:** Evaluate researched texts for validity, reliability, and credibility of source, content, and/or author.

&lt;page_number&gt;9&lt;/page_number&gt;

CREATIVE WRITING AND LITERARY MAGAZINE Supplemental Standards for English Language Arts

# CREATIVE WRITING & LITERARY MAGAZINE

## INTRODUCTION

Students often have the opportunity to experience expository writing in the classroom but have little time to tap into the power and joy of human imagination. Creative Writing allows them to promote self-expression, to explore various writing styles, to experiment with modes of storytelling, and to strive for variety in diction, sentence structure, and format. These benefits are in addition to the development of critical thinking, interpersonal communication, and personal edification and fulfillment.

These standards were created knowing that not all LEAs and schools have a literary magazine or publication. Therefore, Strand 5 may not be applicable to all creative writing courses. Students may find writing opportunities for their work through writing groups, publications, scholarships, contests, or workshops. Additionally, examples in the standards are not meant to be viewed as an exhaustive checklist of items to teach but rather help to better define the standard.

High school Creative Writing and Literary Magazine courses are applied or advanced courses that may be used to fulfill up to one credit of the English Language Arts graduation requirement. These standards align with the Utah Core Standards for English Language Arts.

**Strand 1: Writing Process.** Students will use the iterative process of writing to produce various types of narratives, poetry, and prose.

*   **Standard 1.1:** Generate and/or capture multiple ideas for writing through observation, processing, discussion, and reading.
*   **Standard 1.2:** Focus ideas on addressing what is most significant and/or relevant for a specific genre, purpose, and audience.
*   **Standard 1.3:** Use various techniques for organizing ideas such as outlining, storyboarding, timelines, and plotting.
*   **Standard 1.4:** Compose multiple drafts with revisions as needed showing growth based on self-evaluation and/or feedback.
*   **Standard 1.5:** Edit following the conventions of English as appropriate for grade level, genre, and purpose.

&lt;page_number&gt;15&lt;/page_number&gt;

*   **Standard 2.2:** Analyze craft, style, voice, theme, and conventions in their own and other student’s writing in a variety of genres and modes.

*   **Standard 3.2:** Craft vivid writing with attention to sound elements (e.g., alliteration, assonance, consonance, rhyme), figurative language, sensory details, scenes, and purposeful word choice and syntax.
*   **Standard 3.3:** Develop a range of characters (e.g., main characters vs support/side, flat vs round, protagonist vs antagonist).
*   **Standard 3.4:** Demonstrate an understanding of the impact of “telling language” and “showing language.”
*   **Standard 3.5:** Effectively weave together narration, description, and dialogue using correct conventions.
*   **Standard 3.6:** Distinguish among and incorporate various points of view and narrative tense.
