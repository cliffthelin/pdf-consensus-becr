UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for MATHEMATICS
Mathematics | Grade 1
"In Grade 1, instructional time should focus on four critical areas: (1) developing understanding
of addition, subtraction, and strategies for addition and subtraction within 20; (2) developing
understanding of whole number relationships and place value, including grouping in tens
and ones; (3) developing understanding of linear measurement and measuring lengths as
iterating length units; and (4) reasoning about attributes of, and composing and decomposing
geometric shapes."
"(1) Students will develop strategies for adding and subtracting whole numbers based on
their prior work with small numbers. They will use a variety of models, including discrete
objects and length-based models (for example, cubes connected to form lengths), to model
add-to, take-from, put-together, and take-apart; compare situations to develop meaning
for the operations of addition and subtraction; and develop strategies to solve arithmetic
problems with these operations. Students will understand connections between counting
and addition and subtraction (for example, adding two is the same as counting on two). They
will use properties of addition to add whole numbers and to create and use increasingly
sophisticated strategies based on these properties (for example, ""making tens"") to solve
addition and subtraction problems within 20. By comparing a variety of solution strate-
gies, children will build their understanding of the relationship between addition and
subtraction."
"(2) Students will develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods
to add within 100 and subtract multiples of 10. They will compare whole numbers (at least
to 100) to develop understanding of and solve problems involving their relative sizes. They
will think of whole numbers between 10 and 100 in terms of tens and ones (especially
recognizing the numbers 11 to 19 as composed of a ten and some ones). Through activi-
ties that build number sense, they will understand the order of the counting numbers and
their relative magnitudes."
"(3) Students will develop an understanding of the meaning and processes of measure-
ment, including underlying concepts such as iterating (the mental activity of building up
the length of an object with equal-sized units) and the transitivity principle for indirect
measurement."
"(4) Students will compose and decompose plane or solid figures (for example, put two tri-
angles together to make a quadrilateral) and build understanding of part-whole relation-
ships, as well as the properties of the original and composite shapes. As they combine
shapes, they will recognize them from different perspectives and orientations, describe
their geometric attributes, and determine how they are alike and different to develop the
background for measurement and for initial understandings of properties such as congru-
ence and symmetry."

For example: If 6 x 4 = 24 is known, then 4 x 6 = 24 is also known (commutative property of multiplication). 3 x 5 x 2 can be found by 3 x 5 = 15, then 15 x 2 = 30, or by 5 x 2 = 10, then 3 x 10 = 30 (associative property of multiplication). Knowing that 8 x 5 = 40 and 8 x 2 = 16, one can find 8 x 7 as 8 x (5 + 2) = (8 x 5) + (8 x 2) = 40 + 16 = 56 (distributive property). (Third grade students may, but need not, use formal terms for these properties.)"

Mathematics | Grade 4
"In Grade 4, instructional time should focus on three critical areas: (1) developing
understanding and fluency with multi-digit multiplication, and developing understanding of
dividing to find quotients involving multi-digit dividends; (2) developing an understanding
of fraction equivalence, addition and subtraction of fractions with like denominators, and
multiplication of fractions by whole numbers; and (3) understanding that geometric figures
can be analyzed and classified based on their properties, such as having parallel sides,
perpendicular sides, particular angle measures, and symmetry."
"(1) Students will generalize their understanding of place value to 1,000,000, understand-
ing the relative sizes of numbers in each place. They will apply their understanding of
models for multiplication (equal-sized groups, arrays, area models), place value, and prop-
erties of operations, in particular the distributive property, as they develop, discuss, and
use efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods to compute products of multi-digit
whole numbers. Depending on the numbers and the context, they will select and accu-
rately apply appropriate methods to estimate or mentally calculate products. They will
develop fluency with efficient procedures for multiplying whole numbers, understand and
explain why the procedures work based on place value and properties of operations, and
use them to solve problems. Students will apply their understanding of models for divi-
sion, place value, properties of operations, and the relationship of division to multiplica-
tion as they develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable procedures to
find quotients involving multi-digit dividends. They will select and accurately apply ap-
propriate methods to estimate and mentally calculate quotients, and interpret remainders
based upon the context."
"(2) Students will develop understanding of fraction equivalence and operations with frac-
tions. They will recognize that two different fractions can be equal (for example, 15/9 =
5/3), and they will develop methods for generating and recognizing equivalent fractions.
Students will extend previous understandings about how fractions are built from unit frac-
tions, composing fractions from unit fractions, decomposing fractions into unit fractions,
and using the meaning of fractions and the meaning of multiplication to multiply a frac-
tion by a whole number."

Mathematical PRACTICES (4.MP),
The Standards for Mathematical Practice in Fourth Grade describe mathematical habits of,
mind that teachers should seek to develop in their students. Students become mathematical-,
"ly proficient in engaging with mathematical content and concepts as they learn, experience,",
and apply these skills and attitudes (Standards 4.MP.1-8).,
Standard 4.MP.1,Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. Explain the
,"meaning of a problem, look for entry points to begin work on the problem, and plan"
,"and choose a solution pathway. When a solution pathway does not make sense, look for"
,another pathway that does. Explain connections between various solution strategies
,"and representations. Upon finding a solution, look back at the problem to determine"
,"whether the solution is reasonable and accurate, often checking answers to problems"
,using a different method or approach.
Standard 4.MP.2,Reason abstractly and quantitatively. Make sense of quantities and
,their relationships in problem situations. Contextualize quantities and operations by
,using images or stories. Decontextualize a given situation and represent it symboli-
,"cally. Interpret symbols as having meaning, not just as directions to carry out a proce-"
,"dure. Know and flexibly use different properties of operations, numbers, and geometric"
,objects.
Standard 4.MP.3,Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.
,"Use stated assumptions, definitions, and previously established results to construct"
,"arguments. Explain and justify the mathematical reasoning underlying a strategy, solu-"
,"tion, or conjecture by using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and"
,"actions. Listen to or read the arguments of others, decide whether they make sense, ask"
,"useful questions to clarify or improve the arguments, and build on those arguments."
Standard 4.MP.4,Model with mathematics. Identify the mathematical elements of a
,situation and create a mathematical model that shows the relationships among them.
,"Identify important quantities in a contextual situation, use mathematical models to"
,"show the relationships of those quantities, analyze the relationships, and draw conclu-"
,"sions. Models may be verbal, contextual, visual, symbolic, or physical."
Standard 4.MP.5,Use appropriate tools strategically. Consider the tools that are avail-
,"able when solving a mathematical problem, whether in a real-world or mathematical"
,"context. Choose tools that are relevant and useful to the problem at hand, such as draw-"
,"ings, diagrams, technologies, and physical objects and tools, as well as mathematical"
,tools such as estimation or a particular strategy or algorithm.
Standard 4.MP.6,Attend to precision. Communicate precisely to others by crafting care-
,ful explanations that communicate mathematical reasoning by referring specifically to
,"each important mathematical element, describing the relationships among them, and"
,"connecting their words clearly to representations. Calculate accurately and efficiently,"
,and use clear and concise notation to record work.

Standard 4.OA.1,"Interpret a multiplication equation as a comparison (for example, interpret 35 = 5 x 7 as a statement that 35 is 5 times as many as 7 and 7 times as many as 5). Represent verbal statements of multiplicative comparisons as multiplication equations."
Standard 4.OA.2,"Multiply or divide to solve word problems involving multiplicative comparison, for example, by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem, distinguishing multiplicative comparison from additive comparison."
Standard 4.OA.3,"Solve multi-step word problems posed with whole numbers and having whole-number answers using the four operations, including problems in which remainders must be interpreted."
a.,Represent these problems using equations with a letter standing for the unknown quantity.
b.,"Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies, including rounding."
Standard 4.OA.4,Find all factor pairs for a whole number in the range 1-100. Recognize that a whole number is a multiple of each of its factors.

Standard 4.OA.5,"Generate a number or shape pattern that follows a given rule. Identify apparent features of the pattern that were not explicit in the rule itself. For example, given the rule ""add 3"" and the starting number 1, generate terms in the resulting sequence and observe that the terms appear to alternate between odd and even numbers. Explain informally why the numbers will continue to alternate in this way."

1,000,000."
Standard,"4.NBT.1 Recognize that in a multi-digit whole number, a digit in one place repre-
sents ten times what it represents in the place to its right. For example, recognize that 700
÷ 70 = 10 by applying concepts of place value and division."
Standard,"4.NBT.2 Read and write multi-digit whole numbers using base-ten numer-
als, number names, and expanded form. Compare two multi-digit numbers based on

,Understand addition and subtraction of fractions as joining and separating parts referring to the same whole.
,"Decompose a fraction into a sum of fractions with the same denominator in more than one way, recording each decomposition by an equation. Justify decompositions, for example, by using a visual fraction model. For example, 3/8 = 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8; 3/8 = 1/8 + 2/8; 2 1/8 = 1 + 1 + 1/8; 2 1/8 = 8/8 + 8/8 + 1/8."
,"Add and subtract mixed numbers with like denominators, for example, by replacing each mixed number with an equivalent fraction, and/or by using properties of operations and the relationship between addition and subtraction. For example, 3 1/4 + 2 1/4 = 13/4 + 9/4 = 22/4; 3 1/4 + 2 1/4 = (3+ 2) + (1/4 + 1/4) = 5 + 2/4 = 5 2/4, which is equivalent to 22/4."
,"Solve word problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions referring to the same whole and having like denominators, for example, by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem."
4.NF.4,Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction by a whole number.
,"Understand a fraction a/b as a multiple of 1/b. For example, use a visual fraction model to represent 5/4 as the product 5 x (1/4), recording the conclusion by the equation 5/4 = 5 x (1/4)."
,"Understand a multiple of a/b as a multiple of 1/b, and use this understanding to multiply a fraction by a whole number. For example, use a visual fraction model to express 3 x (2/5) as 6 x (1/5), recognizing this product as 6/5. (In general, n x (a/b) = (n x a)/b)."
,"Solve word problems involving multiplication of a fraction by a whole number (for example, by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem). For example, if each person at a party will eat 3/8 of a pound of roast beef, and there will be five people at the party, how many pounds of roast beef will be needed? Between what two whole numbers does your answer lie?"
4.NF.5,"Express a fraction with denominator 10 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 100, and use this technique to add two fractions with respective denominators 10 and 100. For example, express 3/10 as 30/100, and add 3/10 + 4/100 = 34/100."
4.NF.6,"Use decimal notation for fractions with denominators 10 or 100. For example, rewrite 0.62 as 62/100, describe a length as 0.62 meters; locate 0.62 on a number line diagram."

"In Grade 5, instructional time should focus on three critical areas: (1) developing fluency with
addition and subtraction of fractions, and developing understanding of the multiplication of
fractions and of division of fractions in limited cases (unit fractions divided by whole numbers
and whole numbers divided by unit fractions); (2) extending division to two-digit divisors,
integrating decimal fractions into the place value system and developing understanding of
operations with decimals to hundredths, and developing fluency with whole number and
decimal operations; and (3) developing understanding of volume."
"(1) Students will apply their understanding of fractions and fraction models to represent
the addition and subtraction of fractions with unlike denominators as equivalent calcula-
tions with like denominators. They will develop fluency in calculating sums and differenc-
es of fractions, and make reasonable estimates of them. Students will also use the mean-
ing of fractions, of multiplication and division, and the relationship between multiplication
and division to understand and explain why the procedures for multiplying and dividing
fractions make sense. (Note: This is limited to the case of dividing unit fractions by whole
numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions.)"
"(2) Students will develop understanding of why division procedures work based on the
meaning of base-ten numerals and properties of operations. They will finalize fluency
with multi-digit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They will apply their
understandings of models for decimals, decimal notation, and properties of operations
to add and subtract decimals to hundredths. They will develop fluency in these computa-
tions, and make reasonable estimates of their results. Students will use the relationship
between decimals and fractions, as well as the relationship between finite decimals and
whole numbers (e.g., a finite decimal multiplied by an appropriate power of 10 is a whole
number), to understand and explain why the procedures for multiplying and dividing fi-
nite decimals make sense. They will compute products and quotients of decimals to hun-
dredths efficiently and accurately."
"(3) Students will recognize volume as an attribute of three-dimensional space. They will
understand that volume can be measured by finding the total number of same-size units
of volume required to fill the space without gaps or overlaps. They will understand that a
one-unit-by-one-unit-by-one-unit cube is the standard unit for measuring volume. They
will select appropriate units, strategies, and tools for solving problems that involve esti-
mating and measuring volume. They will decompose three-dimensional shapes and find
volumes of right rectangular prisms by viewing them as decomposed into layers of arrays
of cubes. They will measure necessary attributes of shapes in order to determine volumes
to solve real-world and mathematical problems."
