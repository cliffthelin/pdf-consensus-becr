UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for SOCIAL STUDIES
WORLD GEOGRAPHY
"Geography is the study of physical and human characteristics of the Earth's peo-
ple, places, and environments. Students will develop geographic thinking skills by
studying the ""why of where"" as they examine the interactions, interconnections, and
implications of forces shaping our world today. They will apply geographic knowl-
edge and geo-literacy skills to identify, locate, interpret, analyze, and evaluate geo-
graphic patterns and processes. These standards emphasize both human geography
and physical geography, and students will explore the interconnections between the
two."
Civic Preparation
"One of the fundamental purposes for public schools is the preparation of young peo-
ple for participation in America's democratic republic. The progress of our communi-
ties, state, nation, and world rests upon the preparation of young people to under-
stand the interconnections and interactions between their local, national, and global
communities in order to make reasoned and far-reaching decisions. The study of ge-
ography supports students in understanding how human and natural systems inter-
act and connect places to each other. Geographically informed students can better
participate in their communities and the world in a responsible, informed and civi-
cally minded way. The skills and habits of mind that students develop as they study
the world through geography will nurture their sense of citizenry, as well as civic and
global awareness."
"To that end, throughout this course, students should have ample opportunities to:"
"] Apply spatial analysis and reasoning to identify, examine, and rationalize a
variety of issues facing local, national, and global communities today."
"] Consider various perspectives, including political, historical, economic, cul-
tural, and environmental aspects to analyze and explain current events."
"] Develop and demonstrate the values that sustain America's democratic re-
public, including open-mindedness, engagement, honesty, problem-solving,
responsibility, diligence, resilience, empathy, self-control, and cooperation."
Foundational Geographic Skills
"The study of world geography begins with asking geographic questions. Students of
geography use information gleaned from geographic texts such as maps, statistics,
geospatial technology, media, and other geographic information to answer those
questions. Geography students use evidence to make inferences about the intercon-
nections and interactions between people and places. They also use spatial thinking
to identify patterns and processes occurring at various scales. The following stan-"

UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for SOCIAL STUDIES
"dards promote foundational skills and dispositions vital to the discipline of geography. These
skills and dispositions are reinforced in subsequent strands as students engage with specific
geographic content and inquiry."
"Students will have ample opportunities, throughout the course, to:
] Conduct geographic investigations at various scales, including local, national, and
global. They will formulate geographic questions, acquire information, select and
organize relevant data, analyze patterns in the data, and arrive at evidence-based
conclusions.
Apply map-reading skills to analyze features, purposes, and uses of various types of
maps, including mental maps.
] Use and create maps, graphs, and other types of data sets to show patterns and pro-
cesses influencing our world.
] Use existing and emerging technologies, such as GIS and other geospatial technolo-
gies, whenever possible and appropriate.
] Compare the implications of interactions and interconnections between various peo-
ple and places at various scales.
] Use evidence to analyze and explain the spatial organization of people, places, and
environments and how they have changed over time."
"A Note on the Organization of the Utah Standards in All Core Areas
The Geography core standards are organized into strands, which represent significant areas of
learning within content areas. Depending on the core area, these strands may be designated by
time periods, thematic principles, modes of practice, or other organizing principles."
"Within each strand are standards. A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficien-
cy to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected.
While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards
are essential for mastery."
"WG Strand 1: HUMANS AND THEIR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
The earth's physical environment varies greatly from place to place. The interactions between
physical systems and human systems create opportunities and challenges for people and plac-
es. The implications of these interactions affect both physical systems and human systems."
"Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:
] How does the physical geography of a place influence the lives of the people in that
place?
] What are the most significant consequences of human interactions with their
environment?
] How do physical and human characteristics help geographers define a region?"

UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for SOCIAL STUDIES
Foundational Skills of the Social Studies Disciplines
"It is vital that students develop skills using the unique approaches found in the social studies disciplines. Students will use historical thinking to analyze, evaluate, and use historical evidence, including primary and secondary sources, artifacts, photographs, art, the writing of historians, historical fiction, and historical resources of other genres, such as museum exhibits and websites, to independently construct and defend in writing their interpretations of historical eras and events. They will corroborate their sources of evidence, and place their interpretations within historical contexts."
"Among other elements of historical thinking, students should have opportunities to consider the concept of historical significance. Of all the events that have happened in the past, historians determine those that are significant enough for study. Led by their teachers, students should have opportunities to consider and discuss the relative significance of diverse events."
"Further, students should develop skills associated with the disciplines of geography, political science, and economics, most notably the ability to construct arguments using the evidence, texts, and tools valued within each discipline. These skills are embedded within the standards in places that seem particularly appropriate. However, local educational agencies and/or teachers can use their discretion to integrate skill instruction in a manner that meets local needs."

"(Ca. 150,000 В.С.Е.-1,000 B.C.E.)"
"The advent of farming, sometimes referred to as the Neolithic Revolution, changed the world in profound ways. The transition from procuring to producing food altered the genetic structure of plants and animals. Some societies became sedentary. Inequalities between individuals and societies grew. Land ownership became more important. Specialization and trade became possible. Large-scale warfare became more common. Written records were needed. The changes that resulted from farming created a substantially different world, leading to the formation of the first civilizations and shaping world history."

The Industrial Revolution raised the standard of living for many, but also expanded inequalities between and within nations. New ideas about the role of government and national identities led to political innovation, with revolutions and independence movements occurring in North America, Latin America, and France. Elsewhere, earlier trends in colonization continued and intensified, with colonial empires integrating nearly all societies. Human migration occurred on a massive scale as demographic trends shifted, slavery declined, and industrialized centers demanded workers.",

UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for SOCIAL STUDIES

A Note on the Organization of the Utah Standards in All Core Areas
"The United States Government and Citizenship core standards are organized into strands,
which represent significant areas of learning within content areas. Depending on the core area,
these strands may be designated by time periods, thematic principles, modes of practice, or
other organizing principles.
Within each strand are standards. A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficien-
cy to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected.
While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards
are essential for mastery."

U.S. GOV Strand 1: FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES
"The framework of the United States Constitution and the functions of government are guided
by principles essential for our way of life. An understanding of how these principles are applied
in the rule of law, government, and politics is vital in order to be a responsible and effective
citizen. Students need to be able to see how the ideals found in the Constitution are present in
many of the issues of the day."

Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:
] How are the principles of government embedded in the Constitution?
"] How did the shortcomings in the Articles of Confederation lead to the development of
the Constitution?"
] How is e pluribus unum related to the concept of federalism?
"] Why is an independent judiciary so essential to our democracy? What are some of the
fundamental purposes of judicial review?"
"] How is judicial review a reflection of, and a response to, changes in our history?"
] What are the exceptional characteristics of the United States' form of government?

"U.S. GOV Standard 1.1: Students will explain how documents, challenges, events, and
ideas such as the rule of law, the social contract, compromise,
