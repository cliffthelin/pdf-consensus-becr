The Utah State Board of Education, in January of 1984, established policy requiring the identification of specific core standards to be met by all K–12 students in order to graduate from Utah’s secondary schools. The Utah State Board of Education regularly updates the Utah Core Standards, while parents, teachers, and local school boards continue to control the curriculum choices that reflect local values.

The Utah Core Standards are aligned to scientifically based content standards. They drive high quality instruction through statewide comprehensive expectations for all students. The standards outline essential knowledge, concepts, and skills to be mastered at each grade level or within a critical content area. The standards provide a foundation for ensuring learning within the classroom.

# UTAH STUDIES

Utah is an amazing place, rich in resources, in geographic wonders, in inspiring history, and in the diversity of its people. The study of Utah permits students to understand more deeply the place they call home, while developing essential skills unique to the social studies disciplines. Within these standards, Utah Studies offers an opportunity for students to learn about their own families and cultures as well as those of others.

The Utah Studies standards are based on four social studies disciplines: history, geography, economics, and civics. Students will explore the complex history of Utah, with examples of creativity, sacrifice, conflict, innovation, inequity, compromise, and leadership. Students will also learn about Utah’s diverse physical geography, encounter Utah’s economic systems and dynamics, and explore local and state-wide political systems.

The range of the Utah Studies standards allows teachers flexibility in designing the course scope and sequence. The course could be organized thematically, with distinct units of study related to the social studies disciplines:

*   Economics
*   Geography
*   History
*   Political science/civics

To assist in developing such a thematic scope and sequence, the social studies discipline most associated with each standard is listed in parentheses after the standard.

Historical context and chronology can also provide an organizing structure for understanding Utah’s geography, economics, and politics. While the standards can be taught thematically, they are organized into five historical periods:

**Prehistory–1847** Thousands of years encompassing the development of complex American Indian ways of life and the beginnings of European exploration

**1847–1896** The exploration and settlement of Utah by Mormon and other pioneers, and the transition from territory to Utah statehood

**1896–1945** Utah’s political, social, and economic development from state-hood to the end of World War II

**1945–2002** The post-World War II era through the 2002 Winter Olympics

**2003–Present** Utah’s recent past, the present, and planning for the future

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for SOCIAL STUDIES

Whether teachers organize their course thematically or chronologically, students will engage in inquiry using the tools, conceptual understandings and the language of historians, geographers, economists, and political scientists at a developmentally appropriate level. Students will craft arguments, apply reasoning, make comparisons, and interpret and synthesize evidence as historians, geographers, economists and political scientists. They will corroborate their sources of evidence and place their interpretations within historical contexts.

Among other elements of historical thinking, students should have opportunities to consider the concept of historical significance. Out of all the events that have happened in the past, historians must determine those that are significant enough for study. Led by their teachers, students should have opportunities to consider and discuss the relative significance of diverse events.

Students will be expected to demonstrate their understanding of each period’s key historic, geographic, economic, and civic concepts by applying those concepts to complete cognitively rigorous tasks. Whenever possible, students will make connections between course content and current issues, helping to deepen their understanding of the context and complexity of civic life and preparing them for civic engagement.

## Civic Preparation

Civic engagement is one of the fundamental purposes of education. The preparation of young people for participation in America’s democratic republic is vital. The progress of our communities, state, nation, and world rests upon the preparation of young people to collaboratively and deliberatively address problems, to defend their own rights and the rights of others, and to balance personal interests with the common good. Social studies classrooms are the ideal locations to foster civic virtue, consider current issues, learn how to act civilly toward others, and build a civic identity and an awareness of global issues. These skills, habits, and qualities of character will prepare students to accept responsibility for preserving and defending their liberties.

To reach these ends, student should have ample opportunities to:

*   Engage in deliberative, collaborative, and civil dialogue regarding historical and current issues.
*   Identify local, state, national, or international problems; engage with solutions to these problems; and share their ideas with appropriate public and/or private stakeholders.
*   Apply knowledge of governmental structure, historical concepts, geographic interrelationships, and economic principles to analyze and explain current events.
*   Develop and demonstrate values that sustain America’s democratic republic, such as open-mindedness, engagement, honesty, problem-solving, responsibility, diligence, resilience, empathy, self-control, and cooperation.

## A Note on the Organization of the Utah Standards in All Core Areas

Utah standards are organized into **strands**, which represent significant areas of learning within content areas. Depending on the core area, these strands may be designated by time periods, thematic principles, modes of practice, or other organizing principles.

&lt;page_number&gt;UTAH STUDIES | 2&lt;/page_number&gt;

## Page 11

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for SOCIAL STUDIES

Within each strand are **standards**. A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficiency to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.

## UT Strand 1: NATIVE INNOVATIONS AND ADAPTATIONS

(Prehistory–Ca. 1847)

The recorded history of Utah spans just a few centuries, yet humans have lived in the land now called Utah for thousands of years. Complex native cultures have developed and flourished in Utah’s distinctive geographic regions. Prehistoric artifacts tell us much about their lives and cultures. For centuries the historic tribes of Utah—the Goshute, Navajo, Paiute, Shoshone, and Ute—adapted to their ever-changing environment, especially after they came into contact with European explorers in 1776. Nearly a century of trade relations transpired while Utah was part of the Spanish Empire, and later Mexico. These tribal nations remain essential and active members of the Utah community.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   How do cultures meet their economic and social needs?
*   What can the study of archaeology tell us about the economies, communities, and other aspects of the cultures of these early peoples?
*   Why is it vital to protect archaeological sites in Utah?
*   What role did geography play in the innovations created by Utah’s Fremont and Ancestral Puebloan peoples?
*   What is the historical significance of the Dominguez and Escalante expedition?
*   How do economic systems, such as the trade networks Europeans developed with American Indian communities, shape and spread cultures?
*   Is conflict inevitable when cultures interact?
*   How did the arrival of European and American trappers alter the human geography of Utah?
*   How did Chief Walker’s leadership, and the leadership of other American Indians, influence the reaction of American Indians to newcomers to the territory?
*   How do the current ways of life of Utah’s Native American tribes reflect changes and continuities?

*   UT Standard 1.1: Students will make evidence-based inferences about the complex ancient cultures in Utah after studying artifacts from the prehistoric era. (history)
*   UT Standard 1.2: Students will analyze and explain the interactions and interconnections between the physical characteristics of Utah and American Indian

cultures using a range of texts, oral histories, and geographic inquiry.
(geography)

*   **UT Standard 1.3:** Students will explain the economic activity of a prehistoric and/or historic American Indian tribal community by using basic economic concepts, including supply, demand, trade, and scarcity. (economics)
*   **UT Standard 1.4:** Students will analyze primary and secondary sources to explain causes and effects of European-American exploration, including the response and involvement of Utah’s American Indian tribes. (history)
*   **UT Standard 1.5:** Students will describe the cultural change and continuity of at least one of Utah’s current sovereign nations as it has responded to changing political, social, and economic forces. Students will use a variety of resources that may include written primary and secondary sources, oral histories, photographs, artifacts, and art. (economics, civics)

# UT STRAND 2: UTAH’S DIVERSE PEOPLES
(Ca. 1847–1896)

The arrival of European immigrants in Utah launched a period of immigration, dramatic cultural change, and conflict among Utah’s many diverse peoples. This period begins with the Mormon migration, expansion of settlement in the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau, and accompanying political conflict, wars, and violence. After 1860 the development of mining and other industries created a complex economy and drew new immigrants to the state, increasing Utah’s religious and cultural diversity. Railroads became an important engine of social, cultural, political, and economic change. Utah’s transition from territory to state was long and difficult. By 1896 Utah had become deeply and increasingly interconnected with the nation and the world.

**Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:**
*   What factors led various peoples to settle in Utah?
*   What geographic factors positioned Utah to become “the crossroads of the West”?
*   What was the role of Brigham Young and other pioneer leaders in the settlement of Utah?
*   How do culture and the interaction of cultures shape a sense of place?
*   How did white settlement effect Native American Indian communities?
*   Why did Utah struggle to attain statehood?
*   How did Mormons interrelate with other immigrant groups in Utah?
*   How did improved transportation, industry, and mining transform Utah’s economy, politics, and other aspects of culture?
*   What were the causes of the various conflicts that occurred during the territorial period? How were these conflicts resolved? What were the lasting consequences of these conflicts?

*   **UT Standard 2.4:** Students will research multiple perspectives to explain one or more of the political, social, cultural, religious conflicts of this period, including the U.S. Civil War and more localized conflicts such as the Utah War, the Mountain Meadows Massacre, the Bear River Massacre, the Black Hawk War, or other Federal-Mormon conflicts. (history)
*   **UT Standard 2.5:** Students will construct an evidence-based argument to explain how the development of transportation and communication networks across the state changed Utah's economy and human geography. (economics, geography)

*   **UT Standard 2.8:** Students will explain how their own connection to Utah is a reflection of the complex history of the state. (history)

## UT Strand 3: UTAH IN THE UNION
(Ca. 1896–1945)

In 1896, Utah became the forty-fifth state, with a newly ratified constitution and a mandate to create a state government. During the next half century, the interplay of national and global forces on Utah increased, from economic crises and industrialization to progressive reforms and two global wars. Utah's human and physical geography influenced everything from the mining industry and labor movements to the placement of wartime infrastructure, including military bases and internment camps for Japanese Americans.

**Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:**
*   What are historic and contemporary examples of Utah's economic interdependence?
*   How can global events occurring in distant parts of the world sometimes affect daily life in Utah?

*   UT Standard 3.2: Students will use primary sources and/or oral histories to analyze the impact of a national/global event such as World War I, the Spanish flu epidemic, the Great Depression, World War II, and Japanese American internment on an individual or community in Utah. (history)
*   UT Standard 3.3: Students will describe the effects of events, movements, and innovations on Utah’s economic development, such as the organized labor movement, farming and industrial improvements, the World Wars, and the Great Depression. (economics)
*   UT Standard 3.4: Students will identify the causes and effects of the Progressive movement using examples from community or state history, such as the organized labor movement, tax reform, the Scofield mine disaster, and education and child labor reforms. (civics)

# UT STRAND 4: UTAH IN THE WORLD
(Ca. 1945–2002)

The post-war era saw massive cultural and economic changes. By the time Utah hosted the 2002 Olympics, the state was globally interconnected as never before. Utah’s economy and world-famous geography became inextricably linked with one another as the snow-sport and tourism industries developed. Industries including mining, agriculture, and technology continued to evolve and expand. Conversations and controversies continued regarding the best ways forward for economic growth, community development, and natural resource management. Additionally, Utah’s cultural landscape continued to evolve and diversify.

**Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:**
*   How did the Cold War affect life in Utah?
*   What unique attributes of Utah’s physical and human geography have had an impact on the growth and development of the state?

## UT Strand 5: LOOKING TOWARDS UTAH’S FUTURE

(Ca. 2003–Present)

In the 21st century, central themes endure: the diffusion of cultures, global interconnectedness, the importance of creating and sustaining community, and the need for a strong economy. Most current events—whether they involve interactions between sovereign American Indian tribal communities and state and federal governments; concerns about water; tensions and questions about the proper role and jurisdiction of local, state, and federal governments; or ideas about how best to grow Utah’s economy—have their roots deeply embedded in the rich history of Utah. Students will now have an opportunity to synthesize their study of Utah with capstone academic work.

**Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:**
☐ How should issues be resolved that involve state, federal, and American Indian lands?
☐ What would be the costs and benefits of Utah hosting another Winter Olympics?
☐ What are the best ways to ensure our growing water needs will be met?

# UNITED STATES HISTORY I

## United States History I

United States History I includes events and issues in United States history from the Age of Exploration through Reconstruction, emphasizing the 18th and 19th centuries. Topics include, but are not limited to, American Indian life, European exploration and colonization, the Revolutionary War, constitutional issues, nation building, expansion, the Civil War, and Reconstruction.

The standards can be taught either chronologically or thematically, but are organized into chronological periods. Periodization is an organizational tool historians use to make connections and draw distinctions. Periods are flexible ways of making meaning, and may overlap chronologically.

Students will be expected to demonstrate their understanding of each period’s key historic, geographic, economic, and civic concepts by applying those concepts to complete cognitively rigorous tasks. Whenever possible, students will be expected to make connections between historically significant events and current issues, helping to deepen their understanding of the context and complexity of civic life and preparing them for civic engagement.

## Civic Preparation

Civic engagement is one of the fundamental purposes of education. It is vital that public schools fulfill their civic mission, the preparation of young people for participation in America’s democratic republic. The progress of our communities, state, nation, and world rests upon the preparation of young people to collaboratively and deliberatively address problems, to defend their own rights and the rights of others, and to balance personal interests with the common good. Social studies classrooms are the ideal locations to foster civic virtue, consider current issues, learn how to act civilly toward others, build a civic identity, and promote an awareness of global issues.

*   Develop and demonstrate values that sustain America’s democratic republic, such as open-mindedness, engagement, honesty, problem-solving, responsibility, diligence, resilience, empathy, self-control, and cooperation.
*   Engage in dialogue regarding American exceptionalism, in the sense of the special character of the United States as a uniquely free nation based on democratic ideals and personal liberty.

## Foundational Skills of the Social Studies Disciplines

Students should develop skills associated with the disciplines of history, geography, political science, and economics, most notably the ability to construct arguments using the evidence, texts, and tools valued within each discipline. Of particular importance in a United States history course is developing the reading, thinking, and writing skills of historians. These skills include the ability to think critically about evidence, use diverse forms of evidence to construct interpretations, and defend these interpretations through argumentative historical writing. Students will corroborate their sources of evidence and place their interpretations within historical contexts.

Among other elements of historical thinking, students should have opportunities to consider the concept of historical significance. Out of all the events that have happened in the past, historians must determine those that are significant enough for study. Led by their teachers, students should have opportunities to consider and discuss the relative significance of diverse events.

These skills are embedded within the standards in places that seem particularly appropriate. However, local educational agencies and/or teachers may use their discretion to integrate skill instruction in a manner that meets local needs.

## A Note on the Organization of the Utah Standards in All Core Areas

Utah standards are organized into **strands**, which represent significant areas of learning within content areas. Depending on the core area, these strands may be designated by time periods, thematic principles, modes of practice, or other organizing principles.

Within each strand are **standards**. A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficiency to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.

## U.S. I Strand 1: THREE WORLDS MEET

(Prehistory—Ca. 1650)

Europe’s exploration of America had a profound impact on the world. For thousands of years, complex and sophisticated American Indian civilizations had flourished in the Americas, separated from other parts of the world by vast bodies of water. After Columbus’ arrival, the lands of the Western Hemisphere were forever connected to the rest of the world. The international slave trade forced millions of Africans to the Americas, bringing these “three worlds” together

in unprecedented ways. Patterns of trade, exploration, conquest, and settlement have ramifications that continue to the present day.

## Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   How do historians and archeologists construct interpretations from artifacts, oral histories, legends, primary sources, and other evidence?
*   What were the motives that led to European exploration?
*   What were the effects of European exploration, especially on the indigenous populations encountered?
*   How has physical geography affected cultures historically? How does it affect cultures today?
*   How is your own cultural history woven into the history of America?

■ **U.S. I Standard 1.1:** Students will analyze evidence, including artifacts and other primary sources to make evidence-based inferences about life among several American Indian nations prior to European exploration of the Americas.

■ **U.S. I Standard 1.2:** Students will compare and evaluate historians’ interpretations of the motivations and conditions that led to European exploration.

■ **U.S. I Standard 1.3:** Students will draw from multiple perspectives and cite evidence to explain the effects of European exploration, specifically on Africa, the Caribbean, and North and South America.

■ **U.S. I Standard 1.4:** Students will identify how the period of exploration has affected the current human geography of the Americas, and in particular the role their own cultural background has played.

## U.S. I Strand 2: COLONIZATION

(Ca. 1565–1776)

Driven by economic, religious, and political opportunities, colonial powers from Europe established footholds, then empires in North America. Many colonists fled poverty or persecution to start new lives in an unfamiliar land. Africans were enslaved and brought to the Americas against their will. Interactions between colonists and the indigenous peoples living in North America added complexity to the colonies. Geographic and cultural factors influenced where colonists settled and how they lived. Sectional and regional differences emerged that would affect American history. Patterns established within the English colonies on the Eastern seaboard would shape many of the dominant political, economic, linguistic, and religious traditions of the United States.

## Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   What is a colony?
*   What role did the concepts of self-government and religious freedom play in the colonial era?

*   How were English colonization patterns on the Atlantic coast different from those of the French colonies in the interior and Spanish colonization in what is now the southwestern United States?
*   How are colonization patterns of the French, Spanish, and English colonies evident in human geography patterns today?

*   **U.S. I Standard 2.1:** Students will identify the economic, social, and geographic factors that influenced the colonization efforts of the Dutch, English, French, and Spanish.

*   **U.S. I Standard 2.2:** Students will compare and contrast the economic, political, and social patterns evident in the development of the 13 English colonies.

*   **U.S. I Standard 2.3:** Students will use primary sources as evidence to contrast the daily life and contexts of individuals of various classes and conditions in and near the English colonies, such as gentry, planters, women, indentured servants, Africanslaves, landowners, and American Indians.

*   **U.S. I Standard 2.4:** Students will explain historic and modern regional differences that had their origins in the colonial period, such as the institution of slavery; patterns of life in urban and rural areas; differences between the French continental interior, Spanish southwest, and English northeast; and the location of manufacturing centers.

# U.S. I Strand 3: THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION

(Ca. 1754–1787)

Enlightened ideas from both sides of the Atlantic, coupled with world events and British policies, led many to question the common sense of the relationship between the American colonies and Britain. Over time, many colonists who had viewed themselves as loyal subjects of the king began to support an independence movement that would result in war, the formation of the United States of America, and the ratification of a unique Constitution. The contributions of Adams, Jefferson, Washington, Hamilton, Madison, and other Founding Fathers, as well as those of men and women of all social classes and conditions, were vital in achieving independence and creating a new nation.

**Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:**

*   What defines a political movement as a revolution?
*   Are there specific conditions that are necessary in order for political revolutions to occur?
*   What were the important political philosophies used to justify the American Revolution and advance the cause of liberty?
*   How does the Declaration of Independence make a case for a new nation?

*   What role did propaganda play in promoting the patriot cause?
*   How do some events, like the winter at Valley Forge and Washington crossing the Delaware, become major parts of the narrative of history when other events, like Morristown and Washington crossing the East River, do not?
*   What led some colonists to become patriots, others to become loyalists, and some to remain neutral?
*   What is American exceptionalism, and in what ways has it shaped how Americans see themselves?

*   **U.S. I Standard 3.1:** Students will use primary sources to identify the significant events, ideas, people, and methods used to justify or resist the Revolutionary movement.

*   **U.S. I Standard 3.2:** Students will compare and evaluate historians’ interpretations of the significant historical events and factors affecting the course of the war and contributing to American victory.

*   **U.S. I Standard 3.4:** Students will explain how the ideas and events of the American Revolution continue to shape American identity.

## U.S. I Strand 4: THE U. S. CONSTITUTION

(Ca. 1781–1789)

American independence brought with it the need for self-government. Dissatisfaction with inadequate early political structures led to the creation of the Constitution. The Constitutional Convention brought together the greatest political minds of the fledgling nation. Through debate and compromise, the Founding Fathers brought together in a unique way the principles and philosophies that had been theorized and tested for centuries. The Bill of Rights was then added, enumerating the rights of American citizens. In the end, the Constitution and Bill of Rights created the structure of a government that has functioned, survived crises, and evolved for over two centuries, affecting the life of every citizen today.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   What were the problems that led to the calling of a Constitutional Convention?
*   What is the evidence that Enlightenment philosophies, the Articles of Confederation, Shays’ rebellion, the Constitutional Convention, the Great Compromise, and the ratification debate all influenced the creation of the Constitution?
*   What vision of civic virtue is evident in the Constitution?
*   How does a compound constitutional republic balance state and federal powers?

*   **U.S. I Standard 4.4:** Students will use evidence to explain how the Constitution is a transformative document that contributed to American exceptionalism.

# U.S. I Strand 5: THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROCESSES

(Ca. 1783–1861)

The United States’ constitutional republic and the political systems that Americans are familiar with took shape as the Constitution was interpreted and applied. Reformers have worked to ensure that increasing numbers and classes of people enjoy the rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. Opposing political parties have worked to mold the leadership, laws, and policies of the new nation in order to fit their vision of America. The first half of the nineteenth century was rich with examples of these organizing efforts that have set precedents still followed in the 21st century.

**Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:**

*   What are the primary functions of political parties?
*   Why are there only two dominant political parties at the national level?
*   Is the two-party political system good for American democracy?
*   Are there conditions that are necessary in order for a reform movement to gain momentum or critical mass?
*   What are the most effective ways to promote reform?
*   How have Supreme Court decisions shaped the government?

*   **U.S. I Standard 5.1:** Students will use evidence to document the development and evolution of the American political party system and explain the historic and current roles of political parties.

*   **U.S. I Standard 5.3:** Students will use case studies to document the expansion of democratic principles and rights over time.

## U.S. I Strand 6: EXPANSION (Ca. 1783–1890)

The territorial expansion of the United States created challenges and opportunities for the young nation. Significant advances in industrial technology, discoveries of vast natural resources, a series of gold rushes, visions of the destiny of the nation, continuing conflicts between American Indians and settlers, disagreements between slave states and free states, and a number of push and pull factors influenced territorial expansion. The physical, political, and human geography of the United States today reflects, in part, the 19th century expansion of the nation.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   What motivated settlers to move west?
*   How do 19th century events such as the Louisiana Purchase and the Mexican-American War continue to affect the United States today?
*   What is the relationship between land and power?
*   How did the continent’s physical geography affect the expansion of the United States?
*   What were the costs and benefits of the Industrial Revolution?
*   How did industrial leaders use markets and capital to grow their businesses?

*   **U.S. I Standard 6.1:** Students will compare and contrast historians’ interpretations of the ideas, resources, and events that motivated the territorial expansion of the United States.
*   **U.S. I Standard 6.2:** Students will use primary sources representing multiple perspectives to interpret conflicts that arose during American expansion, especially as American Indians were forced from their traditional lands and as tensions grew over free and slave holding territory.
*   **U.S. I Standard 6.3:** Students will identify the economic and geographic impact of the early Industrial Revolution’s new inventions and transportation methods, such as the Erie Canal, the transcontinental railroad, steam engines, the telegraph, the cotton gin, and interchangeable parts.
*   **U.S. I Standard 6.4:** Students will make a case for the most significant cultural, political, and economic impacts of territorial and/or industrial expansion.

## U.S. I Strand 7: THE CIVIL WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION
(Ca. 1820–1877)

Trends that started with the earliest colonization of America grew into sectional conflicts, and by the election of Lincoln in 1860 the nation was on the brink of civil war. The war had a profound impact on American society and American identity. Events leading to the war and the heavy toll of the war created a severely fractured America. The period of Reconstruction started the process of mending, but created new controversies as concepts of equality, democracy, and citizenship were redefined. The Civil War era and Reconstruction are important aspects of U.S. history, essential to understanding modern America, including race relations and inequality.

**Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:**
* Why were efforts at compromise unsuccessful immediately prior to the Civil War?
* What caused a growing number of people in the North to be opposed to slavery?
* Was it necessary and worthwhile to wage a war to preserve the Union?
* What does it take for a brother to take up arms against a brother?
* What forces made Reconstruction so difficult?
* Why does the Civil War remain such a defining event for American identity?
* Why does Lincoln reference ideas in the Declaration of Independence when referring to the Civil War?
* What is the proper way to memorialize controversial events and people?

*   **U.S. I Standard 7.1:** Students will explain how slavery and other geographic, social, economic, and political differences between the North, South, and West led to the Civil War.
*   **U.S. I Standard 7.2:** Students will use evidence to interpret the factors that were most significant in shaping the course of the war and the Union victory, such as the leadership of Lincoln, Grant, and Lee; the role of industry; demographics; and military strategies.
*   **U.S. I Standard 7.3:** Students will compare historians’ interpretations of the competing goals of Reconstruction and why many of those goals were left unrealized.
*   **U.S. I Standard 7.4:** Students will use current events to evaluate the implications of the Civil War and Reconstruction for contemporary American life.

# WORLD GEOGRAPHY

**Geography** is the study of physical and human characteristics of the Earth’s people, places, and environments. Students will develop geographic thinking skills by studying the “why of where” as they examine the interactions, interconnections, and implications of forces shaping our world today. They will apply geographic knowledge and geo-literacy skills to identify, locate, interpret, analyze, and evaluate geographic patterns and processes. These standards emphasize both human geography and physical geography, and students will explore the interconnections between the two.

## Civic Preparation

One of the fundamental purposes for public schools is the preparation of young people for participation in America’s democratic republic. The progress of our communities, state, nation, and world rests upon the preparation of young people to understand the interconnections and interactions between their local, national, and global communities in order to make reasoned and far-reaching decisions. The study of geography supports students in understanding how human and natural systems interact and connect places to each other. Geographically informed students can better participate in their communities and the world in a responsible, informed and civically minded way. The skills and habits of mind that students develop as they study the world through geography will nurture their sense of citizenry, as well as civic and global awareness.

To that end, throughout this course, students should have ample opportunities to:

*   Apply spatial analysis and reasoning to identify, examine, and rationalize a variety of issues facing local, national, and global communities today.
*   Consider various perspectives, including political, historical, economic, cultural, and environmental aspects to analyze and explain current events.
*   Develop and demonstrate the values that sustain America’s democratic republic, including open-mindedness, engagement, honesty, problem-solving, responsibility, diligence, resilience, empathy, self-control, and cooperation.

## Foundational Geographic Skills

The study of world geography begins with asking geographic questions. Students of geography use information gleaned from geographic texts such as maps, statistics, geospatial technology, media, and other geographic information to answer those questions. Geography students use evidence to make inferences about the interconnections and interactions between people and places. They also use spatial thinking to identify patterns and processes occurring at various scales. The following stan-

&lt;page_number&gt;WORLD GEOGRAPHY | 17&lt;/page_number&gt;

## Page 26

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for SOCIAL STUDIES

dards promote foundational skills and dispositions vital to the discipline of geography. These skills and dispositions are reinforced in subsequent strands as students engage with specific geographic content and inquiry.

Students will have ample opportunities, throughout the course, to:

*   Conduct geographic investigations at various scales, including local, national, and global. They will formulate geographic questions, acquire information, select and organize relevant data, analyze patterns in the data, and arrive at evidence-based conclusions.
*   Apply map-reading skills to analyze features, purposes, and uses of various types of maps, including mental maps.
*   Use and create maps, graphs, and other types of data sets to show patterns and processes influencing our world.
*   Use existing and emerging technologies, such as GIS and other geospatial technologies, whenever possible and appropriate.
*   Compare the implications of interactions and interconnections between various people and places at various scales.
*   Use evidence to analyze and explain the spatial organization of people, places, and environments and how they have changed over time.

## A Note on the Organization of the Utah Standards in All Core Areas

The Geography core standards are organized into **strands**, which represent significant areas of learning within content areas. Depending on the core area, these strands may be designated by time periods, thematic principles, modes of practice, or other organizing principles.

Within each strand are **standards**. A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficiency to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.

## WG Strand 1: HUMANS AND THEIR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

The earth’s physical environment varies greatly from place to place. The interactions between physical systems and human systems create opportunities and challenges for people and places. The implications of these interactions affect both physical systems and human systems.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   How does the physical geography of a place influence the lives of the people in that place?
*   What are the most significant consequences of human interactions with their environment?
*   How do physical and human characteristics help geographers define a region?

&lt;page_number&gt;WORLD GEOGRAPHY | 18&lt;/page_number&gt;

*   **WG Standard 1.4:** Students will use geographic reasoning to propose actions that mitigate or solve issues, such as natural disasters, pollution, climate change, and habitat loss.

## WG Strnad 2: POPULATION DISTRIBUTION AND MIGRATION

The movement and distribution of people is influenced by many factors, including environmental, cultural, economic, and geopolitical forces. These migration trends alter geographic conditions. Geographers use data to understand population distribution and migration by looking at population characteristics, push and pull factors, and numerous other variables. Analyzing this data offers an opportunity to examine complex and challenging real-world issues.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   Why do people live where they live?
*   Why do people move, sometimes at great risk to themselves?
*   How might population trends influence aspects of daily life at local, regional, or global scales?
*   Why do urbanization patterns differ around the world?
*   How can governmental policies have both intended and unintended consequences for population and migration?
*   What are the costs and benefits of mass urbanization?
*   How do geographers use demographic data to make informed decisions?

*   **WG Standard 2.1:** Students will evaluate the impact of population distribution patterns at various scales by analyzing and comparing demographic characteristics such as gender, age, ethnicity, and population density using maps, population pyramids, and other geographic data.

&lt;page_number&gt;WORLD GEOGRAPHY | 19&lt;/page_number&gt;

*   **WG Standard 2.2:** Students will explain push and pull factors causing voluntary and involuntary migration and the consequences created by the movement of people.
*   **WG Standard 2.3:** Students will investigate the effects of significant patterns of human movement that shape urban and rural environments over time, such as mass urbanization, immigration, and the movement of refugees.

## WG Strand 3: CULTURE

Culture is the total sum of human expression. A culture’s purpose, as well as how and where cultures originate, diffuse, and change, are all topics worth studying. Students will explore religion, language, ethnicity and other cultural characteristics by looking at patterns and processes. As students explore what people care about and care for, they can learn not only about other cultures but also about the unique attributes of their own culture.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   How does culture manifest itself on the landscape of the earth?
*   How does culture influence social structures and gender roles?
*   What effect does globalization and emerging technologies have on the divergence and convergence of culture?
*   How do cultures maintain their identities and traditions?
*   How are humans shaped and influenced by their own cultures?
*   How can learning about other cultures teach us about our own?

*   **WG Standard 3.1:** Students will identify and describe the essential defining characteristics and functions of culture.
*   **WG Standard 3.2:** Students will explain how the physical environment influences and is influenced by culture.

## Page 29

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for SOCIAL STUDIES

## WG Strand 4: POLITICAL SYSTEMS

People organize themselves into distinctive groups. Geographers examine how the interactions between these groups influence the division and control of the earth’s surface. Political systems have profound influences on the lives of people, including their access to resources, economic opportunities, and basic rights.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   How and why do people organize themselves into political entities?
*   How do people distribute power and define roles?
*   How do political structures interact on a global scale?
*   Who holds the power at a variety of scales and how are decisions made?
*   Why is power concentrated in certain parts of the globe?
*   How do political systems protect or deny the rights of marginalized peoples?

*   **WG Standard 4.1:** Students will explain why and how people organize into a range of political structures at different scales.
*   **WG Standard 4.2:** Students will describe and explain the role physical and human characteristics play in establishing political boundaries.
*   **WG Standard 4.3:** Students will explain how cooperation and conflict have many causes, such as differing ideas regarding boundaries, resource control, and land use, as well as ethnic, tribal, and national identities.

## WG Strand 5: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Humans have created complex and varied economic systems. These systems, whether based on free markets or other structures, have various levels of development, infrastructure, and divisions of labor. Economic systems are influenced by their unique landscapes and resources, and their locations influence patterns of interconnections with other economic systems. Geographers can use the insights they learn about economic development to identify patterns or propose solutions to complex issues.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   What and who defines a state as developed?
*   How does culture manifest itself in the development of economic systems?
*   How does geography influence the ways in which people make a living?
*   Why have some regions developed more rapidly than others?
*   What are some of the economic patterns evident in more-developed and less-developed countries?
*   Why are economic activities sometimes located in unexpected or unconventional places?

# WORLD HISTORY

**World History** addresses events and issues in world history from the earliest evidence of human existence to modern times. Whenever possible, students will be expected to make connections between historically significant events and current issues. These connections are intended to add personal relevance and deepen students’ understanding of the world today.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the Neolithic Revolution, the dawn of civilization, the development of world religions, patterns in world trade, contributions of classical civilizations, the diffusion of technology, colonization and imperialism, global conflict, modern revolutions and independence movements, and current trends in globalization.

The standards can be taught chronologically, thematically, or regionally, but are organized into chronological periods. Periodization is an organizational tool historians use to make connections and draw distinctions. Periods are flexible ways of making meaning, and may overlap chronologically.

## Civic Preparation

One of the fundamental purposes for public schools is the preparation of young people for civic engagement in solving local and global problems. The future progress of our communities, state, nation, and world rests upon the preparation of young people to understand the interconnections and interactions between their local, national, and global communities in order to make reasoned and far-reaching decisions. The study of world history supports students in understanding how human and natural systems interact and connect places to each other. Historically literate students can better participate in their communities and the world in a responsible, informed and civically minded way. The skills and habits of mind that students develop as they study world history will nurture their sense civic and global awareness.

To that end, throughout this course, students should have ample opportunities to:

*   Apply historical analysis and reasoning to identify, examine, and rationalize a variety of issues facing local, national, and global communities today.
*   Consider various perspectives including political, historical, economic, cultural, and environmental aspects to analyze and explain current events.
*   Develop and demonstrate the values that sustain America’s democratic republic including open-mindedness, engagement, honesty, problem-solving, responsibility, diligence, resilience, empathy, self-control, and cooperation.

## Page 32

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for SOCIAL STUDIES

## Foundational Skills of the Social Studies Disciplines

It is vital that students develop skills using the unique approaches found in the social studies disciplines. Students will use historical thinking to analyze, evaluate, and use historical evidence, including primary and secondary sources, artifacts, photographs, art, the writing of historians, historical fiction, and historical resources of other genres, such as museum exhibits and websites, to independently construct and defend in writing their interpretations of historical eras and events. They will corroborate their sources of evidence, and place their interpretations within historical contexts.

Among other elements of historical thinking, students should have opportunities to consider the concept of historical significance. Of all the events that have happened in the past, historians determine those that are significant enough for study. Led by their teachers, students should have opportunities to consider and discuss the relative significance of diverse events.

Further, students should develop skills associated with the disciplines of geography, political science, and economics, most notably the ability to construct arguments using the evidence, texts, and tools valued within each discipline. These skills are embedded within the standards in places that seem particularly appropriate. However, local educational agencies and/or teachers can use their discretion to integrate skill instruction in a manner that meets local needs.

While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery of the content and skills.

## WH Strand 1: PREHISTORY TO THE NEOLITHIC REVOLUTION

(Ca. 150,000 B.C.E.–1,000 B.C.E.)

The advent of farming, sometimes referred to as the Neolithic Revolution, changed the world in profound ways. The transition from procuring to producing food altered the genetic structure of plants and animals. Some societies became sedentary. Inequalities between individuals and societies grew. Land ownership became more important. Specialization and trade became possible. Large-scale warfare became more common. Written records were needed. The changes that resulted from farming created a substantially different world, leading to the formation of the first civilizations and shaping world history.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   According to historians and archaeologists, what were the advantages and disadvantages of living as hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, and farmers?

■ WH Standard 1.4: Students will compare life before and after the Neolithic Revolution and cite the most significant effects of that revolution on the development of civilization(s).

## WH Strand 2: THE RISE OF CLASSICAL SOCIETIES
(Ca. 1000 B.C.E.–900 C.E.)

The classical civilizations of the Mediterranean (Egypt, ancient Israel, Greece, and Rome), Persia, China, India, and other regions have had a significant impact on global belief systems, legal systems, governments, culture, and social systems. Some developed vast empires, consolidating government power in revolutionary and influential structures. Emerging contacts between civilization centers began the diffusion of ideas and technologies. Classical civilizations rose and fell under remarkably similar circumstances, exhibiting global patterns.

*Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:*
☐ How can new ideas lead to political and social change?
☐ How are the ideas of a culture reflected in art, sculpture, and architecture?
☐ How do new ways of thinking affect the ways people respond to their surroundings?
☐ Why did many of the great world religions and philosophies develop at roughly the same time period?

* WH Standard 2.3: Students will make evidence-based inferences about the cultural values of classical civilizations, using artistic expressions of various genres as primary sources.

* WH Standard 2.4: Students will explain the impact of early trans-regional trade on the diffusion of religion, ideas, technology, and other aspects of culture.

* WH Standard 2.5: Students will construct an argument for the significant and enduring political, economic, technological, social, or other cultural contributions of classical civilizations.

# WH Strand 3: AN AGE OF EXPANDING CONNECTIONS
(Ca. 500 C.E.–1450 C.E.)

The collapse of classical civilizations ushered in an era of unprecedented connection, sometimes referred to as the post-classical period. The fall of some civilizations opened opportunities for the growth of others, most notably the Islamic world. This era brought increasing oceanic and land trade in trans-regional networks. Civilization spread from its traditional centers as powerful states emerged in Japan, the Asian steppes, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia, and other locations. In spite of their relative isolations, civilizations flourished in the Americas.

**Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:**
*   How did the development of civilizations in the Americas compare with the development of civilizations in other locations?
*   How were civilizations in the Americas able to become advanced in spite of their relative isolation from other civilizations?
*   How did geographic features such as the monsoon winds on the Indian Ocean, the Sahara Desert, and the Strait of Malacca promote or inhibit trade?
*   How did merchant activity and the practice of pilgrimage enrich the Islamic world’s knowledge of geography?
*   Why do many modern historians place greater historical significance on the Mongol Empire than they do on classical Greece or Rome?
*   Why do historians now question the notion of the “Dark Ages” in Europe?

*   WH Standard 3.1: Students will use patterns in trade and settlement to explain how geographic features such as the Indian Ocean, the Saharan Desert, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Strait of Malacca, and the Mediterranean Sea supported or impeded trade.
*   WH Standard 3.2: Students will evaluate historians’ interpretations regarding the patterns in the development of civilizations in the Americas compared to other places in the world.
*   WH Standard 3.3: Students will evaluate the long-term effects of the Mongol conquest, such as the diffusion of ideas, technologies, and diseases.
*   WH Standard 3.4: Students will explain the social, political, religious, technological, and economic changes in medieval Europe that created a context for later European colonization.
*   WH Standard 3.5: Students will identify patterns in the diffusion of technology, writing, religion, political systems, and other elements of civilization, using case studies such as the Chinese impact on Japan, the Arab impact on Mali, the Byzantine impact on Russia, the Roman impact on Europe, and the Olmec impact on later American civilizations.

## WH Strand 4: GLOBAL INTERACTIONS
(Ca. 1400 C.E.–1750 C.E.)

During what is sometimes referred to as the early modern period, the balance of global power shifted toward Europe. Europeans gained increasing control of international trade routes. European exploration led to the inclusion of the formerly isolated Americas and Oceanic regions in global systems. Global connections brought drastic environmental and social changes.

Maritime and land empires were formed not just by Europeans, but by Turkish, American, and Chinese states, creating enduring patterns of colonization. Societies that previously had little contact with civilization centers were no longer isolated. The world seemed to become smaller as global integration, diplomacy, and world trade became more complex. In response, new ways of understanding the world emerged.

## Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:
* How and why do historians create terms such as “Columbian Exchange”?
* How did the Columbian Exchange and Renaissance change life on almost every continent?
* What impact did colonization have on the development of the concept of race and the growthofracism?
* What factors led to Europe’s rise from a relative backwater region to a global power?
* Why did some societies continue to live as hunter-gatherers or Stone Age farmers when most societies around the world adopted metallurgy, intensive agriculture, complex trade networks, and intricate bureaucratic governments?

* WH Standard 4.1: Students will compare the development of Europe’s maritime empires with land-based empires such as those of the Ottoman Turks, Chinese, and Russians.
* WH Standard 4.2: Students will develop an interpretation of whether the ideas embodied in movements such as the Renaissance, the Reformation, scientific revolution, and Enlightenment led to a changing balance of world power.
* WH Standard 4.3: Students will describe the complex cultures of indigenous societies, such as those in Polynesia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Australia, and the Americas.
* WH Standard 4.4: Students will analyze the long-term effects of the Columbian Exchange.
* WH Standard 4.5: Students will compile and corroborate primary sources as evidence to explain the impact of global exchange and colonization.

# WH Strand 5: REVOLUTIONS, INDUSTRIALIZATION, AND EMPIRES

(Ca. 1750 C.E.–1914 C.E.)

The era between 1750 and 1914 was filled with scientific, industrial, intellectual, cultural, technological, and political revolutions. The Industrial Revolution raised the standard of living for many, but also expanded inequalities between and within nations. New ideas about the role of government and national identities led to political innovation, with revolutions and independence movements occurring in North America, Latin America, and France. Elsewhere, earlier trends in colonization continued and intensified, with colonial empires integrating nearly all societies. Human migration occurred on a massive scale as demographic trends shifted, slavery declined, and industrialized centers demanded workers.

*   WH Standard 5.6: Students will identify the key ideas and characteristics of current political, economic, and intellectual revolutions such as a contemporary revolution, a social movement, or an independence movement.

## WH Strand 6: GLOBAL CONFLICTS

(Ca. 1914 C.E.–1989 C.E.)

Conditions introduced in earlier centuries led to total and industrialized war on a global scale in the 20th century. A global economic depression demonstrated the interconnectedness of nations and their colonies. Extremism led to genocides on an unprecedented scale. Intellectuals and artists attempted to make sense of the changing world. European colonies in Africa and

Asia took advantage of global trends to demand, and in many cases achieve, independence. Many African and Latin American nations struggled to free themselves from the legacies of imperialism within the context of the Cold War. The postwar era saw early shifts in power to two superpowers.

**Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:**
* What economic forces contributed to 20th century global conflicts?
* How were independence movements of different eras similar or different?
* How can case studies or microhistories of specific genocides, epidemics, technological developments, population movements, or reform efforts help us understand global patterns?

## WH Strand 7: THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD
(Ca. 1990 C.E.–Present)

The proximity of the recent past can make it difficult to see patterns or to identify the most significant events; however, many of the trends evident throughout history continue in the contemporary world. Recent history has seen greater globalization with the formation of worldwide organizations, multinational corporations and a global culture. New threats such as terrorism, compounded by the struggles of unstable governments, demographic trends, and environmental catastrophes create humanitarian crises. Technological development, industrialization in new areas, and new farming technologies (i.e., the Green Revolution) provide hope for solutions to pressing global problems.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:
* What predictions for the future can be made based on current demographic and urbanization trends?
* What are the advantages and disadvantages of participation in alliances such as the European Union or NATO?
* What are the best ways to combat terrorism?
* Why does human trafficking appear to be on the rise, and what can be done to reduce it?
* Should nations admit refugees who flee poverty, war, or political unrest?
* What is the role of developed nations in promoting the economic growth of underdeveloped nations?
* What are the most urgent international problems? What are the most promising ways to resolve those problems?

* WH Standard 7.1: Students will evaluate the role of global organizations, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), multi-national corporations, military alliances, and other international civic and political institutions within the increasingly global culture of the world.
* WH Standard 7.2: Students will use a variety of evidence, including quantitative data, to evaluate the social and environmental impacts of modern demographic trends, particularly population changes, urbanization, and migration.
* WH Standard 7.3: Students will identify international human rights issues, seek and evaluate solutions, and share their ideas with appropriate public and/or private stakeholders.
* WH Standard 7.4: Students will identify a pressing global problem and select the most promising political, technological, medical, or scientific advances being created to address those problems.

# UNITED STATES HISTORY II

**United States History II** addresses the making of modern America, highlighting the events and issues in United States history from the late Industrial Revolution to modern times. Topics include, but are not limited to, the Industrial Revolution, the Progressive movement, imperialism and foreign affairs, the World Wars, the Great Depression, the Cold War, the civil rights movements, the rise of terrorism, and modern social and political history.

The standards can be taught either chronologically or thematically, but are organized into chronological periods. Periodization is an organizational tool historians use to make connections and draw distinctions. Periods are flexible ways of making meaning, and sometimes overlap chronologically.

Effort should be made to help students make connections between the events and ideas of the past and their lives today. Contextualizing the study of modern America by helping students make connections across the span of U.S. history can enrich and deepen their understanding of their own place in the American story.

## Civic Preparation

One of the fundamental purposes for public schools is the preparation of young people for participation in America’s democratic republic. The future progress of our communities, state, nation, and world rests upon the preparation of young people to collaboratively and deliberatively address problems, to defend their own rights and the rights of others, and to balance personal preferences with the common good. Social studies and history classrooms are the ideal venues to nurture civic virtue, consider current issues, learn how to act civilly toward others, build a civic identity, and nurture global awareness. These skills, habits, and qualities of character will better prepare students to recognize and accept responsibility for preserving and defending their liberties.

To that end, throughout this course, students should have ample opportunities to:

*   Engage in deliberative, collaborative, and civil dialogue regarding historical and current issues.
*   Apply knowledge of governmental structure, historical concepts, geographic interrelationships, and economic principles to analyze and explain current events.
*   Identify local, state, national, or international problems; consider solutions to these problems; and share their ideas with appropriate public and/or private stakeholders.
*   Develop and demonstrate the values that sustain America’s democratic republic, such as open-mindedness, engagement, honesty, problem-solving, responsibility, diligence, resilience, empathy, self-control, and cooperation.

&lt;page_number&gt;UNITED STATES HISTORY II | 33&lt;/page_number&gt;

---


## Page 42

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for SOCIAL STUDIES

Engage in dialogue regarding American exceptionalism, in the sense of the special character of the United States as a uniquely free nation based on democratic ideals and personal liberty.

## Foundational Skills of the Social Studies Disciplines

Students should develop skills associated with the disciplines of history, geography, political science, and economics, most notably the ability to construct arguments using the evidence, texts, and tools valued within each discipline. Of particular importance in a United States history course is developing the reading, thinking, and writing skills of historians. These historical thinking skills include the ability to think critically about diverse forms of evidence, use evidence to construct interpretations, and defend these interpretations through argumentative historical writing. Students will corroborate their sources of evidence, and place their interpretations within historical contexts.

Among other elements of historical thinking, students should have opportunities to consider the concept of historical significance. Out of all the events that have happened in the past, historians must determine those that are significant enough for study. Led by their teachers, students should have opportunities to consider and discuss the relative significance of diverse events.

These skills are embedded within the standards in places that seem particularly appropriate. However, local educational agencies and/or teachers may use their discretion to integrate skill instruction in a manner that meets local needs.

## A Note on the Organization of the Utah Standards in All Core Areas

Utah standards are organized into **strands**, which represent significant areas of learning within content areas. Depending on the core area, these strands may be designated by time periods, thematic principles, modes of practice, or other organizing principles.

Within each strand are **standards**. A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficiency to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.

# U.S. II Strand 1: INDUSTRIALIZATION

(Ca. 1880–1920)

The Industrial Revolution radically changed the daily lives of Americans. The immense industrial growth in the 19th century was fueled by technological innovations, abundant natural resources, and a large unskilled labor force. Migration, urbanization, and immigration are trends that continue into contemporary times.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

How did daily life change for many Americans as industrialization developed?

# U.S. II Strand 2: REFORM MOVEMENTS

(Ca. 1880–1920)

Industrialization and urbanization changed American society in fundamental ways. Reform movements grew in response to these new realities. Urban settings made it easier for people to organize reform movements and recruit new members. The women’s suffrage movement, the Progressive movement, the rise of the temperance movement, and the growth of a number of additional labor, health, and educational reform movements developed as individuals and groups worked to solve society’s new challenges.

*Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:*
☐ Why do people turn to reform movements?

&lt;page_number&gt;UNITED STATES HISTORY II | 35&lt;/page_number&gt;

*   **U.S. II Standard 2.4:** Students will evaluate the short- and long-term accomplishments and effectiveness of social, economic, and political reform movements.

# U.S. II Strand 3: AMERICA ON THE GLOBAL STAGE (Ca. 1890–1920)

By the end of the 19th century, global and domestic events led the U.S. to reconsider the advantages of isolation versus intervention in world affairs. The U.S. increased its role in the world and became enmeshed in global conflicts. Decisions related to isolationism and interventionism continue to be made today.

**Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:**
*   How does the U.S. decide when and why to intervene in world affairs?
*   What were the arguments made for the United States' expansion into territories?
*   What cases can be made for isolationism and interventionism?
*   What are some examples of unintended consequences that result from each?
*   How did the cultural diversity of the U.S. change during this era?
*   How did America's involvement in World War I change American history?

*   **U.S. II Standard 3.1:** Students will describe how the role of the U.S. in world affairs changed at the turn of the 20th century, and evaluate the arguments used to promote or discourage involvement in world affairs, such as those of the "big stick," Mahan, the Roosevelt Corollary, and the Anti-imperialist League.

&lt;page_number&gt;UNITED STATES HISTORY II | 36&lt;/page_number&gt;

*   **U.S. II Standard 3.4:** Students will explain the causes for U.S. involvement in World War I and the effects of the war on the home front, such as migration, trade, sedition act, shortages, voluntary rationing, and the Spanish flu.

## U.S. II Strand 4: TRADITIONS AND SOCIAL CHANGE (Ca. 1920–1970)

Traditions and cultural norms help bind people and nations together; sometimes, those holding fast to traditions find themselves in tension with others who push for reform. The 20th century was a time when these tensions were evident in many aspects of American culture, including the changes in social mores in the “roaring’20s” and the subsequent emergence and ascendency of social change and civil rights movements. Various counter-cultural movements have similarly questioned traditional values and governmental policies. Balancing tradition and reform continues to challenge Americans into the 21st century.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   How have opportunities and personal freedoms changed over time for different groups of Americans?
*   How do historians determine causal factors that lead to social changes?
*   What functions do traditions serve in communities and cultures?
*   Why do historians refer to the 1920s as “roaring”?
*   To what degree have the main objectives of the various civil rights movements from this period been attained?
*   Why did the Vietnam War inspire counter-cultural movements?

*   **U.S. II Standard 4.1:** Students will develop and defend an interpretation of why cultural clashes occurred in the 1920s, citing examples such as science vs. religion, rural vs. urban, Prohibition proponents vs. opponents, and nativism vs. immigration.

groups, assess the strategies used, and evaluate the success of the various civil rights movements in reaching their objectives, paying specific attention to American Indian, women, and other racial and ethnic minorities.

*   **U.S. II Standard 4.4:** Students will identify significant counter-cultural movements of the 20th century as well as the reactions and counter-arguments to those movements, using examples such as the Beatniks, hippies, and the anti-Vietnam War movement.

## U.S. II Strand 5: ECONOMIC BOOM, BUST, AND THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT (Ca. 1920–1940)

Economic cycles of expansion and contraction have had a profound impact on the lives of Americans. There have been a number of economic crises throughout U.S. history, but the Great Depression and the New Deal have had the most significant impact on redefining the role of the government in economic and social policy. The arguments for and against intervention continue to reverberate to the current day.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   What were the post World War I economic conditions and policies that led to the economic boom of the 1920s?

*   **U.S. II Standard 5.1:** Students will investigate how individual and institutional decisions made during the 1920s, such as over-production, buying on credit, poor banking policies, and stock market speculation helped lead to the boom of the 1920s and then the Great Depression.
*   **U.S. II Standard 5.2:** Students will use evidence to investigate the effectiveness of the New Deal as a response to economic crises.
*   **U.S. II Standard 5.3:** Students will explain how economic and environmental conditions, including the Dust Bowl, affected daily life and demographic trends during the Great Depression.
*   **U.S. II Standard 5.4:** Students will craft an argument regarding the role of government in responding to economic conditions after learning about capitalism

and other economic systems, historic cycles of boom and bust, and the New Deal.

## U.S. II Strand 6: ANOTHER GLOBAL CONFLICT AND THE BEGINNINGS OF THE COLD WAR

(Ca. 1930–1950)

World War II transformed American society and redefined the United States’ role in global affairs. The war produced unprecedented levels of violence and human suffering. On the home front, trends both during and after the war would shape American society into the 21st century. The post-war era saw America emerge as one of two superpowers, engaged in a global “cold war” with the Soviet Union. This Cold War had implications for America both at home and abroad.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   How did decisions that leaders made during World War II change the rules of warfare?

*   **U.S. II Standard 6.5:** Students will evaluate the impact of using international economic aid and diplomacy to secure national interests, specifically citing case studies of America’s investment in war-torn nations following the war, such as the Marshall Plan and the Berlin Airlift.

## U.S. II Strand 7: THE COLD WAR ERA AND A CHANGING AMERICA (Ca. 1950–2000)

Cold War ideologies have shaped American life and influenced foreign policy since the middle of the 20th century. Cold War rivalries escalated into hot wars in Korea and Vietnam. Alliances led to proxy wars in a number of contested areas. An arms race escalated fears. Eventually, American and Soviet leaders eased Cold War tensions, and the Soviet Union dissolved, ushering in a period of uncertainty in global affairs. American interests in the Middle East have complicated international policies. Differing political philosophies spurred debates over the size and role of government. Throughout the era, American society, education, culture, and politics were shaped by Cold War tensions, technological developments, and changing demographics.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   How did the Cold War shape domestic policies, foreign policies, and popular culture?
*   What lessons can be learned from the Vietnam and Korean Wars?
*   How was McCarthyism a reflection of Cold War tensions?
*   How did wartime technologies lead to peacetime innovations, such as nuclear weapons/power, space exploration, computers, and communication?
*   What were the main goals of President Johnson’s Great Society?
*   What philosophy regarding the role of government influenced President Reagan’s New Federalism?
*   How did America’s relationship with Israel affect its relationship with other Middle Eastern nations?
*   How has American culture been influenced by technological developments?
*   How did the Watergate crisis demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of modern U.S. politics?

*   **U.S. II Standard 7.1:** Students will compare the causes, major events, military tactics, and outcomes of the Korean and Vietnam Wars.

*   **U.S. II Standard 7.2:** Students will use government documents and other primary sources to investigate the motives behind a Cold War policy, event, or foreign operation, such as Truman Doctrine, containment, the domino theory, the Korean conflict, the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, and Olympic boycotts.

*   **U.S. II Standard 7.3:** Students will develop interpretations of the impact of the Cold War on

American society and culture using evidence such as cultural artifacts from the Cold War era, oral histories, and primary sources.

*   **U.S. II Standard 7.4:** Students will explain how Reagan’s neo-conservatism differed from the policies of previous presidential administrations of this era, most notably Johnson’s Great Society.
*   **U.S. II Standard 7.5:** Students will use evidence to demonstrate how technological developments (such as television and social media), government policies (such as Supreme Court decisions), trends (such as rock ‘n’ roll or environmental conservation), and/or demographic changes (such as the growth of suburbs and modern immigration) have influenced American culture.
*   **U.S. II Standard 7.6:** Students will use historical events and trends associated with American policies toward Israel and Middle Eastern nations and groups to make suggestions for current policies.

## U.S. II Strand 8: THE 21ST CENTURY UNITED STATES

(Ca. 2000–Present)

The United States continues to confront social, political, and economic changes. The “War on Terror,” new threats from old rivals, and international humanitarian needs dominate foreign affairs. Continuing political themes surface in current events. Economic inequalities, racial tensions, environmental issues, and immigration and social reforms dominate domestic concerns. In addition, emerging technologies and innovations hold great promise, and the creativity and civic engagement of Americans continues to thrive. The next chapter in the story of the United States awaits.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   How are newspapers, magazines, blogs, and other contemporary expressions the “rough drafts” of history?
*   How do we know what events or trends are of historical significance when we are living in the middle of them?
*   How has U.S. foreign policy had an effect on the War on Terror?
*   What is the most appropriate role for America to play in foreign affairs after the fall of the Soviet Union?
*   How does the U.S. dependency on oil shape foreign policy decision making?
*   In what ways has social media affected the continuity and change of reform movements?
*   How has global trade transformed local communities (e.g., “mom and pop” stores, jobs, manufacturing)?

# UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENSHIP

**The goal of this course** is to foster informed, responsible participation in public life. Knowing how to be a good citizen is essential to the preservation and improvement of the United States. Upon completion of this course the student will understand the major ideas, protections, rights, structures, and economic systems that affect the life of a citizen in the United States. Additionally, students will practice the skills needed to conduct inquiries, weigh evidence, make informed decisions, and participate in political processes. This course should nurture desirable dispositions including a commitment to the American ideals of liberty, equality, opportunity, and justice for all. This course is recommended for seniors due to their proximity to voting age.

## Foundational Practices for Civic Preparation

One of the fundamental purposes for public schools is the preparation of young people for participation in America’s democratic republic. The future progress of our communities, state, nation, and world rests upon the preparation of young people to collaboratively and deliberatively address problems; to defend their own rights and liberties, as well as the rights and liberties of others; and to balance personal preferences with the common good. Social studies and history classrooms are the ideal venue to nurture civic virtue, consider current issues, practice acting civilly toward others, build a civic identity, and nurture global awareness. These skills, habits, and qualities of character will better prepare students to recognize and accept responsibility for preserving and defending the liberties secured by the Constitution.

To reach these ends, student should have ample opportunities to:

*   Engage in deliberative, collaborative, and civil dialogue regarding historical and current issues.
*   Apply knowledge of governmental structure, historical concepts, geographic interrelationships, and economic principles to analyze and explain current events.
*   Identify local, state, national, or international problems, consider solutions to these problems, and share their ideas with appropriate public and/or private stakeholders.
*   Develop and demonstrate the values that sustain America’s democratic republic, such as open-mindedness, engagement, honesty, problem-solving, responsibility, diligence, resilience, empathy, self-control, and cooperation.
*   Engage in dialogue regarding American exceptionalism, in the sense of the special character of the United States as a uniquely free nation based on democratic ideals and personal liberty.

## A Note on the Organization of the Utah Standards in All Core Areas

The United States Government and Citizenship core standards are organized into **strands**, which represent significant areas of learning within content areas. Depending on the core area, these strands may be designated by time periods, thematic principles, modes of practice, or other organizing principles.

Within each strand are **standards**. A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficiency to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.

## U.S. GOV Strand 1: FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

The framework of the United States Constitution and the functions of government are guided by principles essential for our way of life. An understanding of how these principles are applied in the rule of law, government, and politics is vital in order to be a responsible and effective citizen. Students need to be able to see how the ideals found in the Constitution are present in many of the issues of the day.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   How are the principles of government embedded in the Constitution?
*   How did the shortcomings in the Articles of Confederation lead to the development of the Constitution?
*   How is *e pluribus unum* related to the concept of federalism?
*   Why is an independent judiciary so essential to our democracy? What are some of the fundamental purposes of judicial review?
*   How is judicial review a reflection of, and a response to, changes in our history?
*   What are the exceptional characteristics of the United States’ form of government?

*   **U.S. GOV Standard 1.1:** Students will explain how documents, challenges, events, and ideas such as the rule of law, the social contract, compromise, the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, Shays’ Rebellion, and the Federalist Papers significantly influenced the United States Constitution.

*   **U.S. GOV Standard 1.2:** Students will describe the structure of the United States’ form of government as a compound constitutional republic, including the ideas of federalism; checks and balances; separation of powers; commerce, elastic, and supremacy clauses; popular sovereignty; and limited government.

*   **U.S. GOV Standard 1.3:** Students will explain the organization, functions, and processes of the United States government, such as the purpose of the President’s cabinet, the function of judicial review, and how a bill becomes a law, and apply that understanding to current issues.

## U.S. GOV Strand 2: CIVIL LIBERTIES, CIVIL RIGHTS, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

American citizenship brings with it civil liberties, civil rights, and responsibilities. Students must know their rights and responsibilities and understand the extent of those rights. Students should be able to defend their own rights and the rights of others, understanding that the Constitution and its amendments extend protections to individuals who may not share their views. Our nation’s future rests on the ability and willingness of every generation to fulfill their civic responsibilities.

### Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:

*   What are the civil rights and liberties codified in the Constitution?
*   What is the relationship between a successful, functioning republic and a civically responsible population?
*   How have the rights and liberties in the Constitution been interpreted and applied over time?
*   How has the definition of citizen changed over time?

■ **U.S. GOV Standard 2.1:** Students will use historic and modern case studies, including Supreme Court cases, amendment initiatives, and legislation to trace the application of civil liberties, civil rights, and responsibilities spelled out in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and other amendments.

■ **U.S. GOV Standard 2.2:** Students will examine various perspectives on a current rights-related issue; take a position; defend that position using the Constitution and Bill of Rights, historical precedents, Supreme Court decisions, and other relevant resources; and share that position, when possible, with relevant stakeholders.

■ **U.S. GOV Standard 2.3:** Students will explain the purpose and importance of fulfilling civic responsibilities, including serving on juries; voting; serving on boards, councils, and commissions; remaining well-informed; contacting elected officials; and other duties associated with active citizenship.

## U.S. GOV Strand 3: DISTRIBUTION OF POWER

The Constitution distributes authority between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Additionally, power embedded in the federalist system, or compound constitutional republic, is distributed between the federal, state, and local governments. American Indian tribal governments maintain a unique relationship with other levels and branches of government, adding yet another dimension for consideration. Finally, individuals and groups use a range of strategies and methods for wielding their own political power.

## U.S. GOV Strand 4: FISCAL POLICIES AND DECISIONS

Fiscal policies can have profound implications in the daily lives of citizens. An essential component of understanding government and civics rests in deliberating government’s role in the economy. Informed citizens understand taxation, budgets, and debt as these concepts relate to the government. Students use this understanding of basic economic principles to make in-

# U.S. GOV Strand 5: THE U.S. AND OUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE WORLD

As a global superpower with an enormous influence on other nations, it is vital to understand the ways in which the U.S. interacts with the world. Whether through negotiating trade agreements, protecting the security of this nation and its allies, cooperating in humanitarian campaigns, creating infrastructure to handle immigration and refugee demands, or any number of other initiatives, this nation has significant interrelationships with other countries and international bodies. These complex relationships deserve study if students are to understand the global implications of decisions made by leaders and policymakers.

**Possible Guiding Questions to Consider:**
☐ How do we determine what is in our national interest, and how should that determination guide our foreign policy?
☐ What are the best ways to ensure the future economic health of the United States?
☐ What role should the United States play in addressing global economic, environmental, or social issues?

■ **U.S. GOV Standard 5.1:** Students will analyze the constitutional process of creating foreign policy and the structures through which the federal government interacts with foreign governments, such as the Department of State, treaties, agreements, and alliances.
