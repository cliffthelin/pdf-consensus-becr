ASSESSMENT EXEMPLARS
"SEED Discussion—Teacher assigns roles (leader, manager, checker, communicator) and begins by providing each student with the reading material and a set of questions to guide students as they target possible “seeds” for discussion. After reading and referencing the questions independently, the next step is to provide students with an opportunity to write and refine their target “seeds.” Students meet in their groups and assume their assigned roles. Students begin the discussion by presenting their “seeds” to one another, each ""seed"" should be discussed by all group members before moving on to the next. Teachers ask students to determine the strongest and weakest “seeds” in the discussion."
"Rubrics for Active Speaking and Listening—Assessment could include a rubric with the following elements: communication, active listening, questioning, use of evidence, support and respect, building on and paraphrasing, synthesis, research/preparation, etc."
Example performance assessment: Socratic seminar or fishbowl discussion
1. Give students time to prepare their ideas by reading and annotating the text(s) before the discussion. Consider giving students guiding questions to focus their thinking. (You may also use an audio or video clip for students to analyze and discuss.)
2. Develop norms and provide sentence stems.
3. Assign a partner to each student and give them a letter A and B.
4. Organize a group discussion:
"a. For the first round of discussion, the A group will begin discussion with a question to spark conversation. The B group will mark the number of times their A partner engages in the discussion and how (respond, ask question, interrupt, change subject, etc.). Switch roles after around 15 minutes of discussion."
b. Repeat with B group engaging in discussion while A group observes.
"Reciprocal Teaching/Literature Circles—Roles for collaborative conversations—predict, question, clarify, summarize"
Think-Write-Pair-Share
1. Students think individually about a topic or question.
2. Students write individually about a topic or question.
