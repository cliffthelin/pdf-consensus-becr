**ASSESSMENT EXEMPLARS**

*   SEED Discussion—Teacher assigns roles (leader, manager, checker, communicator) and begins by providing each student with the reading material and a set of questions to guide students as they target possible “seeds” for discussion. After reading and referencing the questions independently, the next step is to provide students with an opportunity to write and refine their target “seeds.” Students meet in their groups and assume their assigned roles. Students begin the discussion by presenting their “seeds” to one another, each “seed” should be discussed by all group members before moving on to the next. Teachers ask students to determine the strongest and weakest “seeds” in the discussion.
*   Rubrics for Active Speaking and Listening—Assessment could include a rubric with the following elements: communication, active listening, questioning, use of evidence, support and respect, building on and paraphrasing, synthesis, research/preparation, etc.
*   Example performance assessment: Socratic seminar or fishbowl discussion
    1.  Give students time to prepare their ideas by reading and annotating the text(s) before the discussion. Consider giving students guiding questions to focus their thinking. (You may also use an audio or video clip for students to analyze and discuss.)
    2.  Develop norms and provide sentence stems.
    3.  Assign a partner to each student and give them a letter A and B.
    4.  Organize a group discussion:
        a. For the first round of discussion, the A group will begin discussion with a question to spark conversation. The B group will mark the number of times their A partner engages in the discussion and how (respond, ask question, interrupt, change subject, etc.). Switch roles after around 15 minutes of discussion.
        b. Repeat with B group engaging in discussion while A group observes.
*   Reciprocal Teaching/Literature Circles—Roles for collaborative conversations—predict, question, clarify, summarize
*   Think-Write-Pair-Share
    1.  Students think individually about a topic or question.
    2.  Students write individually about a topic or question.

3. Students pair with a partner to share their thoughts. Pairs may then join with another partnership to make a discussion group of four
4. Each partnership or group of four shares their collective thoughts/ answers to the discussion question

■ Save the Last Word
1. Identify a text, audio, or video excerpt that will serve as the catalyst for this activity.
2. Have students read or view the selected text.
    a. Ask students to highlight three sentences that particularly stood out for them and write each sentence on the front of an index card.
    b. On the back, students should write a few sentences explaining why they chose that quote—what it meant to them, reminded them of, etc. They may have connected it to something that happened in history or is happening in current events.
3. Divide students into groups of three and assign letters A, B, and C to students in each group.
    a. Invite letter A students to read one of their quotes to the group.
    b. Have students B and C discuss the quote: What do they think it means? Why do they think these words might be important? To whom?
    c. After several minutes of discussion, ask student A to read the back of their card thus having “the last word.”
    d. The process continues with student B sharing while A and C discuss and ends with C sharing while A and B discuss.

# GRAMMAR AND CONVENTIONS PROGRESSION CHART

The following table provides a suggested list of grammar and conventions for teachers to use when implementing the P-12 Utah English Language Arts Standards, specifically writing standards one through three and speaking and listening standard three. Teaching grammar and conventions is a component of overall language instruction. Therefore, this instruction needs to be embedded within contexts where students are authentically producing and consuming language (i.e., reading, writing, and speaking and listening) rather than taught as isolated skills.
