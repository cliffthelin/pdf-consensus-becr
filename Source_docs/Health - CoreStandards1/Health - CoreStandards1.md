The Utah State Board of Education, in January of 1984, established policy requiring the identification of specific core standards to be met by all K-12 students in order to graduate from Utah's secondary schools. The Utah State Board of Education regularly updates the Utah Core Standards, while parents, teachers, and local school boards continue to control the curriculum choices that reflect local values.

The Utah Core Standards are aligned to scientifically based content standards. They drive high quality instruction through statewide comprehensive expectations for all students. The standards outline essential knowledge, concepts, and skills to be mastered at each grade level or within a critical content area. The standards provide a foundation for ensuring learning within the classroom.

## ORGANIZATION OF THE STANDARDS
The Utah Core Standards are organized into strands, which represent significant areas of learning within content areas. Depending on the core area, these strands may be designated by time periods, thematic principles, modes of practice, or other organizing principles.

Within each strand are standards. A standard is an articulation of the demonstrated proficiency to be obtained. A standard represents an essential element of the learning that is expected. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all standards are essential for mastery.

# UTAH CORE STATE STANDARDS for HEALTH EDUCATION

# INTRODUCTION

The academic success of Utah’s students is strongly linked to their health. The goal of Health Education is to support parents and families in developing healthy, responsible students who have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to work together in an inclusive manner to think critically and participate in a variety of activities that lead to lifelong healthy behaviors. The inclusion of health in a student’s education positively contributes to their ability to learn, focus, and achieve health and wellness throughout their lives. The Utah Core Standards for Health Education focus on overall health which includes physical, mental, emotional, and social health in each of the six strands:

*   **Health Foundations and Protective Factors of Healthy Self (HF)** is intended to be the foundation of the Health Education Core. Protective factors are attributes such as skills, strengths, or coping strategies which increase the health and well-being of children. These attributes help people deal more effectively with stress, peer-pressure, and other potentially harmful situations. Students with strong protective factors are less likely to develop mental illness or substance use disorders. Students should receive instruction on this strand first. It should also be interwoven throughout all other strands. The goal of this strand is to develop fundamental skills for overall health and wellness.

*   **Mental and Emotional Health (MEH)** teaches students how to advocate for the mental and emotional health of self and others. Students will learn and adopt behaviors which will also maintain and enhance physical and social health. Strategies to help students manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are key components of this strand.

*   **Safety and Disease Prevention (SDP)** helps students understand their role in protecting themselves and others from unintentional danger, risk, injury, or disease. Students will learn and adopt behaviors which will maintain and enhance overall health.

*   **Substance Abuse Prevention (SAP)** promotes overall health by teaching students the knowledge and skills to make choices to avoid substance abuse. Students will practice resisting negative peer pressure, understand marketing tactics, and learn the benefits of a substance free lifestyle.

*   **Nutrition (N)** helps students understand the vital role food preparation and consumption will have on health throughout their life. A

healthy diet supports the immune system and reduces the occurrence of many diseases. Proper nutrition is linked to learning readiness, academic achievement and decreased discipline and emotional problems. Students will learn how to choose or obtain the food necessary for overall health.

* Human Development (HD) teaches students how their body changes throughout their lifespan, how to care for and protect their bodies in a way that is developmentally and age appropriate, and characteristics of a healthy relationship. Students will learn and adopt behaviors which will maintain and enhance overall health.

The standards align vertically from kindergarten through high school, systematically building on knowledge and skills each year to confidently practice and reinforce healthy behaviors. Health Education helps students adopt and maintain healthy behaviors that protect health and avoid or reduce health risks for themselves and others. By the end of Health II, students will have developed the knowledge and skills necessary to make healthy decisions, achieve health literacy, and adopt health-enhancing attitudes and behaviors which will provide a foundation for leading healthy, productive lives.

In kindergarten, Health Education is the introduction to healthy behaviors. Students will begin learning information in four strands:

*   **Health Foundations and Protective Factors of Healthy Self (HF)** is intended to be the foundation of the Health Education Core. Protective factors are attributes such as skills, strengths, or coping strategies which increase the health and well-being of children. Students with strong protective factors are less likely to develop mental illness or substance use disorders. Students will begin building strong protective factors to support their health and wellness in school.
*   **Mental and Emotional Health (MEH)** teaches students how to advocate for the mental and emotional health of self and others. Strategies to help students manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are key components of this strand.
*   **Nutrition (N)** helps students understand the vital role food preparation and consumption will have on their health throughout their life. A healthy diet supports the immune system and reduces the occurrence of many diseases. Proper nutrition is linked to learning readiness, academic achievement, and decreased discipline and emotional problems. Students will learn the importance of food choices and how to properly fuel the body.
*   **Human Development (HD)** teaches students how their body changes throughout their lifespan, and how to care for and protect their bodies in a way that is developmentally and age appropriate. The focus will be hygiene and appropriate touch.

Students should be encouraged to involve parents and families in the skills and lessons they learn.

# GRADE 1

Health Education in first grade supports the health and well-being of students through instruction of foundational behaviors in each strand:

*   **Health Foundations and Protective Factors of Healthy Self (HF)** is intended to be the foundation of the Health Education Core. Protective factors are attributes such as skills, strengths, or coping strategies which increase the health and well-being of children. These attributes help people deal more effectively with stress, peer-pressure, and other potentially harmful situations. Students with strong protective factors are less likely to develop mental illness or substance use disorders. Students will begin looking at specific skills and behaviors that build resiliency and develop strong protective factors.
*   **Mental and Emotional Health (MEH)** teaches students how to advocate for the mental and emotional health of self and others. Students will learn and adopt behaviors which will also maintain and enhance physical and social health. Strategies to help students manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are key components of this strand. Students will begin learning bully prevention strategies.
*   **Safety and Disease Prevention (SDP)** helps students understand their role in protecting themselves and others from unintentional danger, risk, injury, or disease. Students will learn and adopt behaviors which will maintain and enhance health.
*   **Substance Abuse Prevention (SAP)** improves health by teaching students the knowledge and skills to make choices to avoid substance abuse. Students will learn the difference between helpful and harmful substances and begin to practice resisting negative peer pressure.
*   **Nutrition (N)** helps students understand the vital role food preparation and consumption will have on their health throughout their life. A healthy diet supports the immune system and reduces the occurrence of many diseases. Proper nutrition is linked to learning readiness, academic achievement, and decreased discipline and emotional problems. Students will learn how to select a variety of healthy foods at each meal to appropriately fuel their bodies for growth.

Students should be encouraged to involve parents and families in the skills and lessons they learn.
