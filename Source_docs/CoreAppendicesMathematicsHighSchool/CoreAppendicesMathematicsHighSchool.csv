MODERN MATHEMATICS STANDARDS,
Prerequisite: Secondary Math II,
"This course introduces students to topics in modern mathematics as they apply to real-world contexts. The course extends students' understanding of the mathematics developed in Algebra 1 and Geometry. The course is intended to help students develop an understanding of how mathematics describes and explains the world in which they live. Students will extend their mathematical literacy, problem-solving skills, and enthusiasm for the power and beauty of mathematics as a tool for quantifying their world.",
"Teachers will select a minimum of five objectives per semester to explore, and may modify indicators to meet those objectives. Teachers are encouraged to select topics which are of particular interest to their students. Because the topics within the course are not intended to build on one another, students may enter or exit the class throughout the academic year.",
