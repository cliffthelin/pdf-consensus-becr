The Utah State Board of Education, in January of 1984, established policy requiring the identification of specific core standards to be met by all K-12 students in order to graduate from Utah's secondary schools. The Utah State Board of Education regularly updates the Utah Core Standards, while parents, teachers, and local school boards continue to control the curriculum choices that reflect local values.

The Utah Core Standards are aligned to scientifically based content standards. They drive high quality instruction through statewide comprehensive expectations for all students. The standards outline essential knowledge, concepts, and skills to be mastered at each grade level or within a critical content area. The standards provide a foundation for ensuring learning within the classroom.

# Introduction

The school library program is critical to students' academic and personal success. The necessary skills for college and career ready students include literacy in a wide range of digital, visual, and textual formats. Effective school library media programs enable students to develop critical thinking skills to access, evaluate, synthesize, and apply information; make informed decisions; build a knowledge base; and value reading.

These Utah Standards for Library Media were created by certified teacher librarians to support the integration of information literacy and media skills across the curriculum. They are intended to be taught, not in isolation, but in collaboration with classroom teachers. This collaboration will deepen student learning, foster independent reading, develop reading stamina, build task resiliency, strengthen text-dependent writing, and increase the students' information literacy. The standards are organized into three clusters:

1.  Reading Engagement
2.  Research and Information
3.  Media Literacy

Informative handouts, tutorials, and implementation tools are available through the Utah State Office of Education website at http://www.schools.utah.gov/CURR/library/Core/K5.aspx and the Utah Education Network. For example, a scope and sequence is available to support implementation of the standards across the K–5 continuum.

# Reading Engagement

Reading engagement is a foundational skill for learning, personal growth, and enjoyment. The degree to which students can read and understand text in all formats and all contexts is a key indicator of success in school and in life. The goal is to actively promote reading and provide equitable access to literary and informational texts in a variety of subjects, genres, and formats. The standards facilitate the acquisition of tools, knowledge and skills to allow every student to read for interpretation and the development of new understandings.
