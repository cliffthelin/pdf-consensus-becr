# Task 4.3 TDD Compliance Fixes Summary

## Issue Identified
Task 4.3 tests were not compliant with agent steering rules that require:
- Tests must run application code against real user-provided files
- No artificial test scenarios or mock data
- Tests should return "not applicable" when scenarios don't exist in real data
- Same results as production would produce

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Replaced Artificial Test Scenarios
**File**: `tests/unit/test_mapping_iou.py`

**Before**: Created artificial BoundingBox objects and SeedBlock instances with hardcoded values
**After**: Tests use real PDF data from user's target PDF file via `file_manager.get_target_pdf_path()`

### 2. Real Data Testing Approach
- Tests now extract actual seed blocks from user's PDF using `SeedBlockDetector`
- IoU calculations tested with real bounding boxes from PDF content
- Variation mapping tested against actual block data
- Tests skip with "not applicable" when real data doesn't support the test scenario

### 3. Fixed Page Numbering Consistency
- Corrected VariationBlock validation to use 0-based page numbering (consistent with SeedBlock)
- Fixed page number validation from `< 1` to `< 0` to match application behavior

### 4. Test Classes Converted
- `TestIoUCalculations` → `TestRealVariationMapping`
- `TestMatchConfiguration` → `TestMatchConfigurationWithRealData`  
- `TestExactMatchHandling` → `TestRealBlockMatching`
- `TestOffByTooMuchScenarios` → `TestVariationMappingOutcomes`
- `TestMetadataPreservation` → `TestMetadataPreservationWithRealData`
- `TestMatchingStatistics` → `TestRealMatchingStatistics`
- `TestVariationBlockManagerIntegration` → `TestRealVariationBlockManagerIntegration`

## Test Results
- 9 tests passed, 1 skipped (due to missing NDJSON data - correctly "not applicable")
- All tests now validate real application functionality
- Tests properly skip when user data doesn't support the scenario

## Additional Non-Compliant Files Identified
- `tests/unit/test_io_validation.py` - Creates artificial NDJSON records instead of testing real files
- Other test files may need similar compliance fixes

## Compliance Status
✅ Task 4.3 tests now fully compliant with TDD steering rules
✅ Tests validate real application behavior against user files
✅ Proper "not applicable" handling when scenarios don't exist in real data
