### Data Flow Architecture
```
PDF File → GBG Processing → Seed Variations → External Import → 
Consensus Scoring → User Review → Manual Override → Export
```

## Testing Implementation

### Unit Tests (`tests/gui/test_review_gui.py`)
- **28 Test Cases** covering all major components
- **Component Testing**: Individual testing of PDF viewer, variations panel, import dialog
- **Integration Testing**: Testing of signal connections and data flow
- **Mock-Based Testing**: Proper mocking to avoid GUI dependencies in CI

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_review_gui_workflow.py`)
- **Complete Workflow Testing**: End-to-end workflow from PDF loading to export
- **Real File Integration**: Testing with actual PDF files and components
- **Signal Integration**: Verification of proper signal/slot connections
- **Error Handling**: Testing of error scenarios and recovery
