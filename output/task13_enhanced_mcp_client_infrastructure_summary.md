### 6. Event-Driven Connection Handlers

**Connection Events:**
- `connected`: Successfully connected to server
- `disconnected`: Connection closed or lost
- `failed`: Connection attempt failed
- `reconnecting`: Attempting to reconnect
- `offline`: Entered offline mode

**Handler System:**
- Configurable event handlers for connection events
- Asynchronous and synchronous handler support
- Event data with timestamps and context
- Error handling in event handlers
- Multiple handlers per event type support

### 7. Enhanced Request Management

**Request Features:**

- Pending request monitoring
- Request retry logic for connection failures
- Offline request handling

**Timeout Management:**
- Per-request timeout configuration
- Global timeout settings
- Timeout error handling and reporting
- Request cancellation on timeout
- Timeout statistics tracking

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced MCPClient Class

```python
class MCPClient:
    def __init__(self, server_url: str = "ws://localhost:8765", 
                 reconnect_attempts: int = 5, 
                 reconnect_delay: float = 2.0,
                 request_timeout: float = 30.0,
                 heartbeat_interval: float = 30.0):
        # Enhanced initialization with connection management parameters
```

**Key Methods Enhanced:**
- `connect()`: Enhanced connection with state management and error handling
- `disconnect()`: Proper cleanup with background task cancellation
- `_handle_connection_failure()`: Comprehensive failure handling and recovery
- `_attempt_reconnection()`: Intelligent reconnection with exponential backoff
- `_enter_offline_mode()`: Offline mode activation and management
- `_process_offline_queue()`: Queue processing when connection restored
- `_heartbeat_monitor()`: Connection health monitoring
- `health_check()`: Comprehensive connection health assessment

### Connection Statistics and Monitoring

**Statistics Available:**
- Connection state and timing information
- Connection attempt counts and success rates
- Offline queue size and processing statistics
- Pending request counts and timing
- Handler registration information
- WebSocket connection status

**Monitoring Methods:**
- `get_connection_stats()`: Detailed connection statistics
- `get_client_info()`: Client configuration and status
- `get_connection_state()`: Current connection state
- `is_connected()`, `is_initialized()`, `is_offline()`: State checks
- `health_check()`: Comprehensive health assessment
